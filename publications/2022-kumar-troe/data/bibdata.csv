THE ASSESSMENT OF VULNERABILITY OF FORESTS IN THE INDIAN WESTERN HIMALAYAN (IWH) REGION COMPRISING THE STATES OF JAMMU & KASHMIR (J&K), HIMACHAL PRADESH (HP) AND UTTARAKHAND (UK) WAS DONE USING SIX INDICATORS OF VULNERABILITY IN THE FORM OF BIOLOGICAL RICHNESS INDEX, DISTURBANCE INDEX, FOREST CANOPY DENSITY, FIRE POINT INTENSITY AND FOREST EXTRACTION INTENSITY OF FRINGE FORESTS. WE EXPRESS THIS ASSESSMENT AS THE INDICATOR-BASED VULNERABILITY. THE INDICATORS WERE ALLOCATED WEIGHTS BY MULTI CRITERIA ANALYSIS USING ANALYTICAL HIERARCHY PROCESS. THE SPATIAL EXTENT OF ALL OF THE SELECTED INDICATORS WAS MAPPED FOR THE IWH REGION AT A PIXEL RESOLUTION OF 24 M AND WAS INTEGRATED TO FIND OUT THE VULNERABILITY FOR EACH PIXEL IN A GIS ENVIRONMENT. THE STUDY AREA WAS DIVIDED INTO 172 GRIDS OF SIZE 0.5, EQUIVALENT TO THE GRID SIZE OF AVAILABLE CLIMATIC PROJECTIONS, OUT OF WHICH 67 GRIDS WERE IDENTIFIED AS THE FOREST GRIDS. THE GRIDS THAT HAVE AT LEAST 5% FOREST COVER WERE DESIGNATED AS THE FOREST GRIDS AND THE VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT WAS DONE ONLY FOR THESE GRIDS. THE FINAL REPRESENTATION OF VULNERABILITY ACROSS FORESTED GRIDS OF THE IWH WAS DONE AT A SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF 5' AND 0.5 TO CATEGORISE AS LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH AND VERY HIGH CLASS. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF VERY HIGH AND HIGH VULNERABLE GRIDS OF 5' SIZE LIES IN THE STATE OF UK, COMPRISING 32 AND 31%, RESPECTIVELY. THE AGGREGATED VALUES AT 0.5 INDICATE THAT MOST OF THE GRIDS OF UK FALL UNDER VERY HIGH VULNERABILITY EXCEPT FOR THE FEW UPPERMOST AND LOWERMOST GRIDS FALLING UNDER OTHER CATEGORIES. IN J&K, MOST OF THE 5' GRIDS FALL UNDER LOW VULNERABILITY (41%), WHILE MEDIUM, HIGH AND VERY HIGH CATEGORIES ARE 27, 25 AND 7%, RESPECTIVELY. SIMILARLY, OUT OF TOTAL 28 GRIDS OF SIZE 0.5, ONLY ONE GRID IS CATEGORIZED AS VERY HIGH VULNERABLE, WHILE 11 GRIDS FALL UNDER HIGH VULNERABILITY. IN HP, NONE OF THE GRIDS OF EITHER SIZE IS CATEGORIZED AS VERY HIGH VULNERABLE. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT MOST OF THE HIGH AND VERY HIGH VULNERABLE GRIDS IN THE IWH ARE IN THE LOWER ALTITUDES WHILE HIGHER ALTITUDES HAVE LESSER MAGNITUDE OF VULNERABILITY. FORESTS OCCURRING AT A HIGHER ELEVATION SUCH AS THE ALPINE FORESTS (DRY, MOIST AND SUB-ALPINE) IS THE LEAST VULNERABLE FORESTS COMPARED TO OTHER FOREST TYPE GROUPS OF THE IWH. 2021 THE AUTHORS","107568",NA,NA,"KUMAR, M.; GIS CENTRE, INDIA; EMAIL: MANOJFRI@GMAIL.COM","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107568","FOREST RESEARCH INSTITUTEFOREST RESEARCH INSTITUTE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGEMINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE,MOEFCC","1470160X","ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS","ENGLISH",0,NA,NA,"ELSEVIER B.V.",NA,"SCOPUS","INDICATOR-BASED VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT OF FOREST ECOSYSTEM IN THE INDIAN WESTERN HIMALAYAS: AN ANALYTICAL HIERARCHY PROCESS INTEGRATED APPROACH","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102446077&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolind.2021.107568&partnerID=40&md5=c693fc421e0aa29c7be18d9c3e86ff2f","125",2021,"AUTHORS ACKNOWLEDGE THE SUPPORT RECEIVED FROM GIS CENTRE, FOREST RESEARCH INSTITUTE, DEHRADUN FOR USING GIS LAB TO IMPLEMENT THIS STUDY.

THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO CHARACTERIZE VEGETATION IN A LANDSCAPE WITH HETEROGENOUS TOPOGRAPHY USING MEDIUM RESOLUTION SENTINEL-2 SATELLITE DATA AND RANDOM FOREST (RF) MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM. THE STUDY AREA FALLS IN THE NANDHAUR LANDSCAPE OF WESTERN HIMALAYAN FOOTHILLS AND FORMS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE TERAI ARC LANDSCAPE. SENTINEL-2 SATELLITE DATA OF JANUARY, APRIL AND MAY MONTHS WASUSED ALONG WITH SRTM DIGITAL ELEVATION MODEL. PRIMARY FIELD DATAWAS COLLECTED FOR DOMINANT VEGETATION COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS AND USED FOR TRAINING AND VALIDATION OF THE MODEL IN RF. A TOTAL OF ELEVEN FOREST VEGETATION COMMUNITIES WAS CHARACTERIZED WITH AN ACCURACY OF 7087% FOR INDIVIDUAL IMAGERIES AS WELL AS IN COLLOCATION OF IMAGES. SATELLITE IMAGE OF APRIL WAS FOUND MOST USEFUL FOR DISCRIMINATING FOREST COMMUNITIES WITH HIGH SPECTRAL SEPARABILITY AMONG COMMUNITIES. VARIABLE IMPORTANT ANALYSIS REVEALED VEGETATION RED EDGE, NARROW NIR AND NIR BANDS WERE USEFUL FOR DISCRIMINATING COMMUNITIES WITH MAXIMUM INFORMATION ALONG WITH SWIR AND RED BANDS. STUDY FOUND THAT COLLOCATION OF THE MULTI-DATE IMAGES WAS USEFUL FOR CLASSIFYING COMMUNITIES WITH HIGHER ACCURACIES. THIS ATTEMPT AT CHARACTERIZING HETEROGENEOUS VEGETATION COMMUNITIES WITH ADVANCED MACHINE LEARNING TOOLS IN HIMALAYAN FOOTHILLS SHOWED ENCOURAGING OUTCOMES WHICH CAN BE USED IN FUTURE STUDIES FOR MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT OF KEY HABITATS IN THIS AREA. 2020, INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING.",NA,NA,NA,"MISHRA, A.P.; BOTANICAL SURVEY OF INDIA, 192 KAULAGARH ROAD, INDIA; EMAIL: ARUNPRATAP7371@GMAIL.COM","ARTICLE","10.1007/s12524-020-01253-x","INDIAN SPACE RESEARCH ORGANISATIONINDIAN SPACE RESEARCH ORGANISATION,ISRO FOREST DEPARTMENT, GOVERNMENT OF UTTARAKHANDFOREST DEPARTMENT, GOVERNMENT OF UTTARAKHAND","0255660X","JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING","ENGLISH",0,"4","759-771","SPRINGER",NA,"SCOPUS","VEGETATION CHARACTERIZATION AT COMMUNITY LEVEL USING SENTINEL-2 SATELLITE DATA AND RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER IN WESTERN HIMALAYAN FOOTHILLS, UTTARAKHAND","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096055419&doi=10.1007%2fs12524-020-01253-x&partnerID=40&md5=4b438ef1da117075a8c70339a2dabc99","49",2021,"THE AUTHORS SINCERELY THANK THE DIRECTOR AND DEAN, INDIAN INSTITUTE OF REMOTE SENSING, ISRO DEHRADUN FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT AND SUPPORT FOR THIS STUDY.

MONIT. ASSESS.","CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) IS THE KEY ATMOSPHERIC GAS THAT CONTROLS THE EARTHS GREENHOUSE EFFECT, AND FORESTS PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN ABATING THE ATMOSPHERIC CO2 BY STORING CARBON AS BIOMASS. THEREFORE, IT IS VITAL TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF DIFFERENT FORESTS IN REGULATING THE SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATION. IN THIS STUDY, WE HAVE USED EDDY COVARIANCE (EC) TOWER-BASED ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATION MEASUREMENTS AND SATELLITE-RETRIEVED COLUMN AVERAGE CO2 CONCENTRATION OF 2018 TO UNDERSTAND THE DIURNAL AND SEASONAL DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATION OVER THE SUB-TROPICAL FOREST IN THE FOOTHILLS OF NORTHWEST HIMALAYA, UTTARAKHAND, INDIA. EC STUDY REVEALED THAT THE CO2 CONCENTRATION OVER THE FOREST CANOPY PEAKS DURING MID-NIGHT TO EARLY MORNING AND DROP TO A MINIMUM DURING THE AFTERNOON. ON A MONTHLY SCALE, PEAK ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATION WAS OBSERVED DURING JULY IN BOTH THE SITES, WHICH WAS A RESULT OF MORE RELEASE OF CO2 BY THE FOREST ECOSYSTEM THROUGH ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION AND MICROBIAL DECOMPOSITION. ENHANCED PHOTOSYNTHETIC ACTIVITIES DURING THE LATE MONSOON AND POST-MONSOON RESULTED IN THE DECREASE OF ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATION OVER THE FOREST ECOSYSTEM. AMONG THE METEOROLOGICAL VARIABLES, RAINFALL WAS FOUND TO HAVE THE HIGHEST CONTROL OVER THE SEASONAL VARIABILITY OF THE ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATION. ORBITING CARBON OBSERVATORY-2 (OCO-2) SATELLITE-RETRIEVED COLUMN AVERAGE CO2 (XCO2) WAS ALSO EXAMINED TO COMPREHEND ITS RELIABILITY ON AN ECOSYSTEM SCALE. THE OCO-2 RETRIEVED XCO2 VALUE WAS HIGHER THAN THE EC CARBON FLUX TOWER-MEASURED ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATION, WHICH MIGHT BE DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN THE VERTICAL RESOLUTION OF THE CO2 COLUMN AND SCALE DIFFERENCE. HOWEVER, THE MONTHLY ATMOSPHERIC XCO2 RETRIEVED FROM OCO-2 STRONGLY ADHERES WITH THE GROUND-MEASURED MONTHLY PATTERN. OUR STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THAT FORESTS WITH VARYING FUNCTIONAL TRAITS WITHIN THE SAME CLIMATIC CONDITIONS SHOW VARIABILITY IN THE REGULATION OF ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATION. 2021, THE AUTHOR(S), UNDER EXCLUSIVE LICENCE TO SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG PART OF SPRINGER NATURE.","106","CARBON DIOXIDE, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; CARBON DIOXIDE","EMASD","PADALIA, H.; FORESTRY AND ECOLOGY DEPARTMENT, 4 KALIDAS ROAD, INDIA; EMAIL: HITENPADALIA@GMAIL.COM","ARTICLE","10.1007/s10661-021-08896-4",NA,"01676369","ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT","ENGLISH",0,"2",NA,"SPRINGER SCIENCE AND BUSINESS MEDIA DEUTSCHLAND GMBH","33532942","SCOPUS","SEASONAL DYNAMICS AND IMPACT FACTORS OF ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATION OVER SUBTROPICAL FOREST CANOPIES: OBSERVATION FROM EDDY COVARIANCE TOWER AND OCO-2 SATELLITE IN NORTHWEST HIMALAYA, INDIA","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100420450&doi=10.1007%2fs10661-021-08896-4&partnerID=40&md5=f8b8d01c9effbe401a73d1054d1cb54e","193",2021,"THE PRESENT STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT AS A PART OF SOIL-VEGETATION ATMOSPHERE-FLUX (SVAF) OF NATIONAL CARBON PROJECT (NCP) SUPPORTED BY ISRO-GEOSPHERE-BIOSPHERE PROGRAMME.

J. REMOTE SENS.","FOLIAR NITROGEN (N) AND CARBON (C) ARE TWO VITAL LEAF BIOCHEMICAL COMPONENTS THAT CAN INDICATE FOREST HEALTH. IN THIS STUDY, THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF FOLIAR N AND C WAS MAPPED USING SENTINEL-2 DATA IN A TROPICAL MOIST DECIDUOUS SAL (SHOREA ROBUSTA) FOREST OF NORTHWEST HIMALAYAN FOOTHILLS OF INDIA. EMPIRICAL RELATIONSHIPS WERE ESTABLISHED BETWEEN SATELLITE DATA-DERIVED SPECTRAL INDICES, BAND REFLECTANCE AND GROUND MEASURED FOLIAR N AND C USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM (MLA). PERFORMANCE OF MLAS VIZ. RANDOM FOREST (RF), ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK (ANN) AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) WERE ASSESSED. USING ALL THE INDEPENDENT SPECTRAL VARIABLES, RF PERFORMED BETTER THAN ANN AND SVM IN EXPLAINING THE VARIATION IN FOLIAR N AND C. RF WAS FURTHER USED TO OPTIMIZE THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLES FOR IDENTIFYING THE BEST PREDICTOR VARIABLES. IT WAS FOUND THAT FOLIAR N IS STRONGLY RELATED TO SHORTWAVE INFRARED-1 (SWIR-1) BAND AND NORMALIZED DIFFERENCE RED EDGE INDEX (NDRE). FOLIAR C WAS FOUND TO BE STRONGLY RELATED TO SWIR-1 BAND AND SPECTRAL VEGETATION INDICES: GREEN NORMALIZED DIFFERENCE VEGETATION INDEX (GNDVI), GREEN RED VEGETATION INDEX (GRVI), GREEN CHLOROPHYLL INDEX (GCI), AND RATIO OF MODIFIED CHLOROPHYLL ABSORPTION IN REFLECTANCE INDEX AND OPTIMIZED SOIL ADJUSTED VEGETATION INDEX (MCARI/OSAVI). USING THESE BEST PREDICTOR VARIABLES, THE SPATIAL VARIABILITY OF FOLIAR N AND C WAS MAPPED USING RF ALGORITHM. ON VALIDATION OF THE PREDICTED N AND C WITH GROUND MEASURED FOLIAR N AND C, R 2 OF 0.85 (RMSE=0.04%) FOR N AND R 2 OF 0.86 (RMSE=0.26%) FOR C WERE OBSERVED. IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT MLAS HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL TO MAP THE SPATIAL VARIABILITY OF FOLIAR N AND C IN THE TROPICAL FORESTS USING THE BROAD BANDS OF SENTINEL-2 IMAGERY. 2020 INFORMA UK LIMITED, TRADING AS TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP.",NA,NA,"IJSED","NANDY, S.; INDIAN INSTITUTE OF REMOTE SENSING, INDIA; EMAIL: SUBRATO.NANDY@GMAIL.COM","ARTICLE","10.1080/01431161.2020.1823043",NA,"01431161","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING","ENGLISH",0,"3","1139-1159","TAYLOR AND FRANCIS LTD.",NA,"SCOPUS","MAPPING SPATIAL VARIABILITY OF FOLIAR NITROGEN AND CARBON IN INDIAN TROPICAL MOIST DECIDUOUS SAL (SHOREA ROBUSTA) FOREST USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS AND SENTINEL-2 DATA","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097205205&doi=10.1080%2f01431161.2020.1823043&partnerID=40&md5=7c6c82470853c526460fcad05e4c5013","42",2021,"NA NA","INDIAN INSTITUTE OF REMOTE SENSING;WILDLIFE INSTITUTE OF INDIA","NOTREPORTED;INDIAN INSTITUTE OF REMOTE SENSING;NOTREPORTED",NA,"VASUDEVA V, 2021, INT J REMOTE SENS","VASUDEVA V, 2021, INT J REMOTE SENS"

HOWEVER, THE CO2 CARBON EXCHANGE CHARACTERISTICS (GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY, NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE, AND ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION) OF INDIAN FORESTS ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. IMMENSE CARBON SEQUESTRATION OPPORTUNITIES EXIST WITH THE NATURAL AS WELL AS PLANTED FORESTS. THEREFORE, IT BECOMES VITAL TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL OF EXISTING FORESTS (NATURAL AND PLANTED) BY MEANS OF THE MOST ACCURATE AND RELIABLE METHODS OF EDDY COVARIANCE (EC). IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE ECO-PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE OF THE FORESTS TOWARDS DIURNAL, SEASONAL, AND YEARLY CHANGES IN THE PREVAILING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. WE ANALYZED CO2 CARBON EXCHANGE CHARACTERISTICS OF A MATURE MOIST DECIDUOUS FOREST AND A YOUNG MIXED DECIDUOUS PLANTATION LOCATED IN THE SUB-TROPICAL CLIMATE REGIME IN THE WESTERN HIMALAYAN FOOTHILLS OF INDIA WITH THE HELP OF CO-LOCATED EC MEASUREMENTS (2016 TO 2018). THE STUDY REVEALS THAT BOTH THE MATURE FOREST ( 719.43 GCM 2YEAR 1) AND YOUNG PLANTATION ( 467.49 GC M 2 YEAR 1) ARE ABSORBING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CARBON. THE MAXIMUM UPTAKE OF ATMOSPHERIC CO2 OCCURRED DURING THE POST-MONSOON SEASON IN BOTH THE FORESTS. THE MINIMUM NEE OF THE MIXED DECIDUOUS PLANTATION WAS OBSERVED DURING THE LEAF FALL PERIOD WHILE THE NEE OF THE MOIST DECIDUOUS FOREST WAS THE LOWEST IN MONSOON DUE TO A HIGHER RESPIRATION RATE DURING MONSOON. AMONG THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, SOIL MOISTURE SHOWED MAXIMUM CONTROL ON THE PRODUCTIVITY OF BOTH THE FOREST ECOSYSTEMS. THE VALUE REPORTED IN THIS STUDY CAN HELP FOREST SURVEY OF INDIA IN ESTABLISHING/ASSESSING EMISSION FACTOR FOR THESE PARTICULAR FOREST TYPES. THIS STUDY CAN ALSO HELP FOREST MANAGERS IN CARBON ASSESSMENT OF PLANTATION UNDER NDC. 2020, SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG.",NA,NA,"BIOGE","PADALIA, H.; INDIAN INSTITUTE OF REMOTE SENSING, INDIA; EMAIL: HITENPADALIA@GMAIL.COM","ARTICLE","10.1007/s10533-020-00727-x",NA,"01682563","BIOGEOCHEMISTRY","ENGLISH",1,"23","291-311","SPRINGER SCIENCE AND BUSINESS MEDIA DEUTSCHLAND GMBH",NA,"SCOPUS","ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL ON CARBON EXCHANGE OF NATURAL AND PLANTED FORESTS IN WESTERN HIMALAYAN FOOTHILLS OF INDIA","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096211406&doi=10.1007%2fs10533-020-00727-x&partnerID=40&md5=c6fb61f9e3ba937a9baf0d02228d9506","151",2020,"THE PRESENT STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT AS A PART OF SOIL-VEGETATION-ATMOSPHERE-FLUX (SVAF) OF NATIONAL CARBON PROJECT (NCP) SUPPORTED BY ISRO-GEOSPHERE-BIOSPHERE PROGRAMME.

THE PRESENT STUDY AIMS TO GENERATE A PFT MAP FOR THE NORTHWEST HIMALAYAN (NWH) FOOTHILLS OF INDIA USING SEASONALITY PARAMETERS, TOPOGRAPHIC CONDITIONS, AND CLIMATIC INFORMATION FROM VARIOUS SATELLITE DATA AND PRODUCTS USING RANDOM FOREST (RF) ALGORITHM IN GOOGLE EARTH ENGINE (GEE) PLATFORM. THE SEASONALITY INFORMATION WAS EXTRACTED BY CARRYING OUT A HARMONIC ANALYSIS OF NORMALIZED DIFFERENCE VEGETATION INDEX (NDVI) TIME-SERIES (2008 TO 2018) FROM MODERATE RESOLUTION IMAGING SPECTRORADIOMETER (MODIS) TERRA SURFACE REFLECTANCE 8 DAY 500 M DATA (MOD09A1). FOR TOPOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, SHUTTLE RADAR TOPOGRAPHY MISSION (SRTM) DIGITAL ELEVATION MODEL (DEM) DERIVED ASPECT AND MULTI-SCALE TOPOGRAPHIC POSITION INDEX (MTPI) WERE USED, WHEREAS, FOR CLIMATIC VARIABLES, WORLDCLIM V2 BIOCLIMATIC (BIOCLIM) VARIABLES WERE USED. RF, A MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFIER, WAS USED TO GENERATE A PFT MAP USING THESE DATASETS. THE OVERALL ACCURACY OF THE RESULTING PFT MAP WAS FOUND TO BE 83.33% WITH A KAPPA COEFFICIENT OF 0.71. THE PRESENT STUDY PROVIDES AN EFFECTIVE APPROACH FOR PFT CLASSIFICATION USING DIFFERENT WELL-ESTABLISHED, FREELY AVAILABLE SATELLITE DATA AND PRODUCTS IN THE GEE PLATFORM.

THE PHENOLOGICAL EVENTS OF THESE SPECIES WERE RECORDED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS (TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION) AND PHONOLOGICAL EVENTS. THE MAIN BRANCHES AND SUB-BRANCHES OF INDIVIDUALS OF EACH SPECIES WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED AND MARKED WITH METAL TAGS TO REPRESENT THE WHOLE CANOPY FROM JANUARY, 2017 TO DECEMBER, 2018. THE DATA WAS ANALYZED WITH THE HELP OF CIRCULAR STATISTICS AND SPEARMAN'S RANK CORRELATION. THE RESULT SHOWED THAT LEAF BUD INITIATION START FROM FEBRUARY AND PEAKS IN MAY. YOUNG LEAVES START EXPANDED IN APRIL AND PEAKS IN JULY, WHEREAS LEAF SENESCENCE STARTS IN AUGUST. LEAF FALL STARTS FROM SEPTEMBER AND PEAKS IN NOVEMBER. FLOWER/FLOWERING BUD STARTS FROM FEBRUARY TO MARCH AND TURNS INTO FLOWER IN APRIL. RIPENING OF FRUITS STARTS FROM APRIL AND PEAKS IN MAY WHILE FRUIT FALL OCCURS IN MAY AND PEAKS IN JUNE. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS PLAY IMPORTANT ROLE IN TIMING AND RECURRING OF PHENOPHASE EVENTS IN ALL THE SPECIES.

THE SOILS EXHIBITED A GRADUAL FINING OF TEXTURE FROM SHIVALIK HILLS TO FLOOD PLAINS. BY AND LARGE, THE SOILS WERE SLIGHTLY ACIDIC TO STRONGLY ALKALINE AND CALCAREOUS. THE MACRO AND MICRONUTRIENTS IRRESPECTIVE OF THE GEOMORPHIC UNIT WERE HIGHER IN SURFACE HORIZONS THAN SUBSURFACE HORIZONS. HOWEVER, NONE OF THE MICRONUTRIENTS EXHIBITED ANY SYSTEMATIC PATTERN OF DISTRIBUTION WITH DEPTH ON DIFFERENT GEOMORPHIC SURFACES. CONTENTS OF ALL MICRONUTRIENTS WERE HIGHER IN FINE-TEXTURED AS COMPARED TO COARSE-TEXTURED SOILS. SOIL PH, ORGANIC MATTER, CALCIUM CARBONATE AND SIZE FRACTIONS HAD STRONG INFLUENCE ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF EXTRACTABLE MICRONUTRIENTS. BASED ON LINEAR COEFFICIENTS OF CORRELATION, DTPA-EXTRACTABLE MICRONUTRIENTS INCREASED WITH INCREASE IN ORGANIC CARBON AND CLAY CONTENT AND DECREASED WITH INCREASE IN PH AND CACO3 CONTENT. ORGANIC CARBON WAS SIGNIFICANTLY AND POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH N, P, K AND MICRONUTRIENTS EXCEPT ZN.

ASSESS.","BIOLOGICAL INVASION IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS THREATS TO BIODIVERSITY AFTER CLIMATE CHANGE. LANDSCAPE DISTINGUISHED BY THE HETEROGENEITY OF STRUCTURE, FORMS, HUMAN INTERFERENCES, AND ENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE ESTABLISHMENT AND SPREAD OF INVASIVE SPECIES. WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECT OF THE SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY FOR A SELECTED LANDSCAPE UPON THE INVASION PROCESS THROUGH A CASE STUDY OF HYPTIS (HYPTIS SUAVEOLENS) IN THE INDIAN WESTERN HIMALAYAN REGION. THE SELECTED STUDY SITE CONSTITUTES A HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPE OF 32,300 HA IN THE STATE OF UTTARAKHAND, PLACED AT THE LOWER ELEVATION OF THE INDIAN HIMALAYA. THE LANDSCAPE HAS VARYING LEVELS AND PATTERNS OF HYPTIS INVASION. WE QUANTIFIED THE SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY IN TERMS OF ELEVATION; DISTANCE FROM THE CANAL, RIVER, ROAD, AND SETTLEMENT; AND 18 LANDSCAPE METRICS (AT THE PATCH AND LAND USE CLASS LEVEL) TO INVESTIGATE THEIR INFLUENCE ON THE INVASION; FOR THIS PURPOSE, A LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL WAS DEVELOPED. THE INVASION OF HYPTIS WAS FOUND TO BE GOVERNED BY SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY. THE HIGHEST PROBABILITY OF INVASION WAS FOUND IN THE AREAS ADJACENT TO RIVERS AND ROADS. THE ANALYSIS AT PATCH LEVEL REVEALED THAT THE INVASION IS LARGELY GOVERNED BY THE PERIMETER-AREA RATIO OF PATCHES AND IS POSITIVELY CORRELATED. THIS SUGGESTS FOR GREATER INVASION CHANCES IN SMALLER PATCHES AS COMPARED WITH LARGER ONES. THE ANALYSIS FOR THE LAND USE CLASS METRICS INDICATED A HIGHER INFLUENCE OF EDGE DENSITY EXPRESSED AS TOTAL EDGE LENGTH OF PATCHES PER UNIT AREA, FOLLOWED BY PATCH DENSITY EXPRESSES AS A TOTAL NUMBER OF PATCHES PER UNIT AREA. HENCE, THE LANDSCAPES WITH LARGER EDGES AND MORE NUMBER OF PATCHES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE MORE PRONE TO INVASION RISKS. THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY CAN BE USED BY FOREST MANAGERS IN DESIGNING A LANDSCAPE-LEVEL SYSTEM TO CONTROL INVASION. 2019, SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG.","794",NA,"EMASD","KUMAR, M.; GIS CENTRE, PO: NEW FOREST, INDIA; EMAIL: MANOJFRI@GMAIL.COM","ARTICLE","10.1007/s10661-019-7682-y","INDIAN COUNCIL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONINDIAN COUNCIL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH AND EDUCATION,ICFRE","01676369","ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT","ENGLISH",4,NA,NA,"SPRINGER","31989314","SCOPUS","DOES SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY OF LANDSCAPE EXPLAIN THE PROCESS OF PLANT INVASION?

LAND USE EXERTS BOTH DIRECT (THROUGH C ADDITIONS) AND INDIRECT (THROUGH ITS IMPACT ON SOIL EROSION) INFLUENCE ON SOIL CARBON. PARTITIONING OF TOTAL CARBON (TC) IN ORGANIC AND INORGANIC FORMS IN DEGRADED SOILS WAS STUDIED, AND COMPARED THESE WITH SOILS UNDER AGRICULTURE, HORTICULTURE AND FOREST SYSTEMS. HIGHEST TOTAL ORGANIC CARBON (TOC) WAS RECORDED IN FOREST SOILS FOLLOWED BY HORTICULTURAL SYSTEMS, WHEREAS THE LEAST WAS OBSERVED IN DEGRADED AND AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS WHILE INORGANIC CARBON (IC) DECREASED IN THE SEQUENCE OF: DEGRADED LANDS &GT; FOREST &GT; AGRICULTURE HORTICULTURE. TOC STOCKS IN THE UPPER HALF-A-METER LAYER WERE 163.9 MG HA1 IN FOREST SOILS FOLLOWED BY HORTICULTURE (144.7 MG HA1) WHILE IN CASE OF TC, THE DEGRADED LANDS CLOSELY FOLLOWED FOREST SOILS. THE CONTRIBUTION OF IC TO TC WAS ABOUT 39% IN DEGRADED LANDS, WHICH WAS ABOUT TWICE THAT OF ITS CONTRIBUTION IN FOREST SOILS. TOC DECREASED WITH SOIL DEPTH WHEREAS IC INCREASED WITH DEPTH. THE INCREASE IN IC WITH DEPTH WAS MINOR FOR AGRICULTURAL AND HORTICULTURAL SOILS, WHEREAS IT WAS ABOUT 84% FOR DEGRADED AND ABOUT 61% FOR FOREST SOILS.

THE TWO ALTITUDINAL RANGES WERE SELECTED BECAUSE OF HAVING COMMON EIGHT LAND USE SYSTEMS VIZ., AGRICULTURE (T1), HORTICULTURE (T2), AGRISILVICULTURAL (T3), SILVOPASTORAL (T4), AGRIHORTICULTURE (T5), AGRIHORTISILVICULTURAL (T6), FOREST (T7) AND GRASSLAND (T8). THE EXPERIMENT WAS CARRIED OUT TO IDENTIFY VARIATION IN DIFFERENT LAND USE SYSTEMS IN TERMS OF BIOMASS PRODUCTION AND CARBON STOCK POTENTIALS. THE MAXIMUM VALUE OF ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS (184.75 T HA-1), BELOWGROUND BIOMASS (47.84 T HA-1) AND TOTAL BIOMASS (232.59 T HA-1) WAS RECORDED IN FOREST LAND USE SYSTEM. ALL TRAITS OF BIOMASS FOLLOWED THE ORDER OF T6&GT;T2 &GT;T5 &GT;T3&GT;T4 &GT;T1&GT;T8.. AMONG THE AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS MAXIMUM ABOVEGROUND (66.46 T HA-1), BELOWGROUND (20.84 T HA-1) AND TOTAL BIOMASS (86.48 T HA-1) WERE ACCUMULATED IN AGRIHORTISILVICULTURE SYSTEM. THE VALUES OF ABOVE, BELOW AND TOTAL BIOMASS SHOWED DECLINING TREND WITH INCREASE IN ALTITUDE. VEGETATION CARBON DENSITY ALSO DECREASED WITH INCREASING ALTITUDINAL RANGE. AMONG AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS, MAXIMUM (90.10 T HA-1) TOTAL CARBON STOCK WAS OBSERVED IN AGRIHORTISILVICULTURE, WHICH WAS 2.45, 4.42, 10.67 AND 44.80% HIGHER THAN AGRIHORTICULTURE, SILVOPASTORAL, AGRISILVICULTURE AND AGRICULTURE LAND USE SYSTEM. 2019, RANGE MANAGEMENT SOCIETY OF INDIA.

PALAEOECOL.","DATA FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE GLOBE INCLUDING THE HIMALAYAN FORELAND SUGGEST THAT THE EXPANSION OF C4 PLANTS WAS NOT SYNCHRONOUS AND HENCE INVOKE INFLUENCES OF REGIONAL FACTORS ON C4 PLANTS EVOLUTION. THE DISPARITY IN THE ABUNDANCE OF C4 PLANTS ACROSS DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE KANGRA SUB-BASIN, NW HIMALAYA, HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO VARIATION IN GRAIN SIZE OF THE SUBSTRATE AND ITS MOISTURE CONTENT. IN THE ABSENCE OF VEGETATION AND CLIMATE DATA FROM THE UPPER SIWALIKS OF THE KANGRA SUB-BASIN, THE PRESENT STUDY CONSIDERS THE ADJACENT SUBATHU SUB-BASIN. THE 13C VALUES OF SOIL CARBONATE NODULE (SC) FROM THE GHAGGAR AND MOGINANDA REGIONS AND FOSSIL TOOTH ENAMEL FROM THE HARIPUR KHOL REGION OF THE SUBATHU SUB-BASIN HAVE BEEN MEASURED AND COMPARED TO DATA FROM THE OTHER SIWALIK REGIONS TO ASSESS THE SPATIO-TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF C4 PLANTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE 18OSC VALUES HAVE BEEN EVALUATED TO RECONSTRUCT LOCAL CLIMATIC CONDITIONS. STABLE CARBON AND OXYGEN ISOTOPE DATA FROM SC ACROSS THE SIWALIKS INDICATE THAT CLIMATE WAS NOT THE ONLY DRIVER INFLUENCING THE C4 PLANT ABUNDANCE. COMPARISON OF THE SEDIMENTARY ARCHITECTURE AMONG THE DIFFERENT SIWALIK REGIONS INDICATES THAT THE ABUNDANCE OF OVERBANK FINE SEDIMENTS IS HIGHER IN THE WESTERN SIWALIKS THAN THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN SIWALIKS. THE 13C VALUES AND ABUNDANCE OF OVERBANK FINE SEDIMENTS ACROSS DIFFERENT SIWALIKS SUGGEST A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OF SUBSTRATE ON THE ABUNDANCE OF C4 PLANT IN THE HIMALAYAN FORELAND. 2018 ELSEVIER B.V.",NA,NA,"PPPYA","GHOSH, S.; DEPARTMENT OF EARTH SCIENCES, INDIA; EMAIL: SAMBITJU@GMAIL.COM","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.palaeo.2018.08.019","SB/S4/ES-684/2013 AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH FOUNDATIONAGRICULTURAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION,ARF COUNCIL OF SCIENTIFIC AND INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH, INDIACOUNCIL OF SCIENTIFIC AND INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH, INDIA,CSIR DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, GOVERNMENT OF KERALADEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, GOVERNMENT OF KERALA DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGYDEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,DOST","00310182","PALAEOGEOGRAPHY, PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY, PALAEOECOLOGY","ENGLISH",10,NA,"341-351","ELSEVIER B.V.",NA,"SCOPUS","SUBSTRATE CONTROL OF C4 PLANT ABUNDANCE IN THE HIMALAYAN FORELAND: A STUDY BASED ON INTER-BASINAL RECORDS FROM PLIO-PLEISTOCENE SIWALIK GROUP SEDIMENTS","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052854798&doi=10.1016%2fj.palaeo.2018.08.019&partnerID=40&md5=148941bb31df2037ea2126cf747d0e44","511",2018,"THIS WORK FORMS PART OF THE PH.D.

HOWEVER, THE ABILITY OF IAPS UNDER CHANGING CLIMATE TO INVADE MOUNTAIN ECOSYSTEMS, PARTICULARLY THE HIMALAYAN REGION, IS LESS KNOWN. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE CURRENT AND FUTURE HABITAT OF FIVE IAPS OF THE HIMALAYAN REGION USING MAXENT AND TWO REPRESENTATIVE CONCENTRATION PATHWAYS (RCPS). TWO INVASIVE SPECIES, AGERATUM CONYZOIDES AND PARTHENIUM HYSTEROPHORUS, WILL LOSE OVERALL SUITABLE AREA BY 2070, WHILE AGERATINA ADENOPHORA, CHROMOLAENA ODORATA AND LANTANA CAMARA WILL GAIN SUITABLE AREAS AND ALL OF THEM WILL RETAIN MOST OF THE CURRENT HABITAT AS STABLE. THE SOUTHERN HIMALAYAN FOOTHILLS WILL MOSTLY CONSERVE SPECIES ECOLOGICAL NICHES, WHILE SUITABILITY OF ALL THE FIVE SPECIES WILL DECREASE WITH INCREASING ELEVATION. SUCH INVASION DYNAMICS IN THE HIMALAYAN REGION COULD HAVE IMPACTS ON NUMEROUS ECOSYSTEMS AND THEIR BIOTA, ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND HUMAN WELL-BEING.

YET, THERE IS NO INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON RESPONSE OF THIS PLANT TO CHANGING CLIMATIC CONDITIONS PARTICULARLY ELEVATED ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATIONS. THEREFORE, WE CONDUCTED AN EXPERIMENT TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF ELEVATED CO2 CONCENTRATIONS (ECS) ON WITHANIA SOMNIFERA. THE VARIATIONS IN TRAITS OF PHYSIOLOGICAL ADAPTATION, NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY, CARBON PARTITIONING, MORPHOLOGY, AND BIOMASS IN RESPONSE TO ELEVATED CO2 CONCENTRATIONS (AMBIENT, 600 AND 800MOL MOL1) DURING ONE GROWTH CYCLE WERE INVESTIGATED WITHIN THE OPEN TOP CHAMBER (OTC) FACILITY IN THE FOOTHILL OF THE HIMALAYAS, DEHARDUN, INDIA. ECS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED PHOTOSYNTHETIC RATE, TRANSPIRATION RATE, STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE, WATER USE EFFICIENCY, SOIL RESPIRATION, NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY AND THE CARBON CONTENT OF PLANT TISSUES (LEAF, STEM, AND ROOT), AND SOIL CARBON. FURTHERMORE, ECS SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED BIOMASS PRODUCTION (ROOT AND SHOOT), ALTHOUGH DECLINED NIGHT LEAF RESPIRATION. OVERALL, IT WAS SUMMARIZED THAT PHOTOSYNTHESIS, STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE, WATER USE EFFICIENCY, LEAF, AND SOIL CARBON AND BIOMASS INCREASED UNDER ECS RENDERING THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ADAPTATION TO THE PLANT. INCREASED NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY MIGHT FACILITATE MITIGATION EFFECTS BY SEQUESTERING ELEVATED LEVELS OF CARBON DIOXIDE.

EARTH SYST. ENVIRON.","THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY IS TO MAP AND EVALUATE THE SOIL EROSION SUSCEPTIBILITY IN PANCHKULA DISTRICT OF HARYANA. BASED ON FIELD SURVEY AND INFORMATION ANALYSIS, 12 FACTORS SUCH AS RAINFALL, VEGETATION COVER, SOIL TYPE, GEOMORPHOLOGY, SLOPE ANGLE, STREAM POWER, SLOPE LENGTH, TOPOGRAPHICAL CURVATURE, DRAINAGE DENSITY, TOPOGRAPHICAL WETNESS, LAND USE/LAND COVER, AND SLOPE ASPECT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS SOIL EROSION STIMULATING FACTORS. DIFFERENT THEMATIC LAYERS OF THESE PARAMETERS USING REMOTE SENSING DATA AND GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS) HAVE BEEN GENERATED AND SUBSEQUENTLY INTEGRATED WITH THE WEIGHTED INDEX OVERLAY (WIO) METHOD FOR THE IDENTIFICATION AND DELINEATION OF SOIL EROSION PRONE AREAS. THE WEIGHT OF EACH THEMATIC LAYER CORRESPONDING TO THE SUSCEPTIBILITY LEVEL HAS BEEN DETERMINED THROUGH THE RANK SUM METHOD TECHNIQUE. THE OBTAINED RESULTS REVEAL THAT ABOUT 32% AREA OF THE DISTRICT IS PRONE TO HIGH AND VERY HIGH EROSION WHICH SPREADS IN NORTH-WESTERN PARTS. IN ORDER TO TEST THE RELIABILITY OF THE ADOPTED MODEL FOR SOIL EROSION SUSCEPTIBILITY, VALIDATION PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN EXECUTED. SOIL EROSION SUSCEPTIBILITY ASSESSMENT COMMENCED BY MEANS OF GEO-STATISTICAL MULTIVARIATE APPROACH MAY BE VERY USEFUL FOR PLANNING EROSION CONTROL MEASURES, WHICH IS A PREREQUISITE FOR INTEGRATED SOIL AND WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT IN THE DISTRICT. 2017, SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING SWITZERLAND.",NA,NA,NA,"SINGH, O.; DEPARTMENT OF GEOGRAPHY, INDIA; EMAIL: OVSHOME@YAHOO.COM","ARTICLE","10.1007/s40808-017-0331-y","NGEE ANN POLYTECHNICNGEE ANN POLYTECHNIC,NA","23636203","MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT","ENGLISH",4,"2","733-753","SPRINGER SCIENCE AND BUSINESS MEDIA DEUTSCHLAND GMBH",NA,"SCOPUS","SOIL EROSION SUSCEPTIBILITY ASSESSMENT THROUGH GEO-STATISTICAL MULTIVARIATE APPROACH IN PANCHKULA DISTRICT OF HARYANA, INDIA","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082683276&doi=10.1007%2fs40808-017-0331-y&partnerID=40&md5=5c0ee07949e3f86fe165ac9e16046495","3",2017,"NA NA","DYAL SINGH COLLEGE;KURUKSHETRA UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED",NA,"SHARMA T, 2017, MODEL EARTH SYST ENVIRON","SHARMA T, 2017, MODEL EARTH SYST ENVIRON"

ECOL.","THIS STUDY IS AN ATTEMPT TO CHARACTERIZE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF LAND USE LAND COVER (LULC) CHANGES, RATE OF DEFORESTATION, AND DEVELOP FUTURE SCENARIOS FOR KOSI RIVER WILDLIFE CORRIDOR USING GEOSPATIAL TOOLS. ONE OF THE KEY CORRIDORS OF TERAI ARC LANDSCAPE, IN THE HIMALAYAN FOOTHILLS OF NORTHERN INDIA, KOSI RIVER CORRIDOR PROVIDES CRUCIAL LINKAGE BETWEEN THE JIM CORBETT TIGER RESERVE AND THE RAMNAGAR FOREST DIVISION. GROWING ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCES IN THE LANDSCAPE HAVE LED TO FRAGMENTATION OF EXISTING WILDLIFE HABITATS. THE CHANGES WERE MAPPED USING REMOTELY SENSED MULTI-DATE SATELLITE IMAGES (2009 AND 2014) IN GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM. LAND CHANGE MODELER WAS USED TO PREDICT LULC DISTRIBUTION FOR 2020 AND 2030 USING CURRENT DISTURBANCE SCENARIOS. THE PREDICTED MAP SHOWED THAT IF THE CURRENT PROBABILITY OF CHANGE PERSISTS, DENSE FOREST WOULD WITNESS A DECLINE OF ABOUT 8.5 KM IN AREA, WHILE AREA UNDER PLANTATION WOULD OCCUPY 4.31% (27.9 KM2) OF THE TOTAL AREA BY 2030. THESE CHANGES ARE SIGNIFICANT GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE AREA IS UNDER PROTECTED AREA STATUS.

SCI. TECHNOL.","MOUNTAINS ARE REMARKABLY DIVERSE AND GLOBALLY IMPORTANT AS CORES OF BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY. MOUNTAINS GREATEST VALUES MAY BE AS SOURCES OF ALL THE WORLD'S MAJOR RIVERS, AND THOSE OF THE HIMALAYAS ARE NO LESS IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF PROVISIONING THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES THAT HAVE THUS FAR SUSTAINED HUGE POPULATIONS OF PEOPLE AND HIGH LEVELS OF BIODIVERSITY. THE SURVIVAL OF THESE ECOSYSTEMS AND WILDLIFE ARE NOW THREATENED BY HUMAN ACTIVITIES SUCH AS TIMBER HARVESTING, INTENSIVE GRAZING BY LIVESTOCK, TOURISM, INDUSTRIALIZATION, AND AGRICULTURAL EXPANSION INTO FORESTLANDS, AND, ABOVE ALL, CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH HAS LED TO THE INVASION OF MANY NOXIOUS WEEDS. THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO ANALYZE THE INVASION STATUS OF ONE SUCH NOXIOUS WEED, LANTANA (LANTANA CAMARA), FROM THE WESTERN HIMALAYAN FOOTHILLS. A TOTAL OF 122 PLANT SPECIES WERE RECORDED AS ASSOCIATES FROM ALL LANTANA INFESTED SITES COMPRISING 73 SHRUBS, 39 HERBS, FIVE SEDGES, AND THREE GRASSES BELONGING TO 47 FAMILIES. FABACEAE AND ASTERACEAE WERE FOUND TO BE THE MOST DOMINANT FAMILIES GROWING GENEROUSLY WITH LANTANA. SIGNIFICANT SITE EFFECT WAS FREQUENTLY OBSERVED THAN EFFECT DUE TO INVASION STATUS. SOIL SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED AND ANALYZED FROM HIGHLY INVADED AND MODERATELY INVADED AREAS TO SEE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOIL PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES AND LANTANA GROWTH. RESULTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY SHOW THAT FACTORS SUCH AS PH, TOTAL NITROGEN, SOIL ORGANIC CARBON, PHOSPHORUS, AND POTASSIUM CONTENTS ARE POSITIVELY IMPELLING LANTANA INVASION IN ALL THE SITES. IN SOME PLACES SOIL NUTRIENTS WERE FOUND IMPROVED EFFECTIVELY DUE TO LANTANA INVASION WHEN COMPARED FROM THE SOIL OF NON-INVADED AREAS THEREBY, INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD OF FURTHER INVASION. 2015 KOREAN FOREST SOCIETY.",NA,NA,NA,"MANDAL, G.; ECOLOGY RESEARCH LABORATORY, DEPARTMENT OF BOTANY, DAV (PG) COLLEGEINDIA","ARTICLE","10.1080/21580103.2014.990062",NA,"21580103","FOREST SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY","ENGLISH",9,"4","182-196","TAYLOR AND FRANCIS LTD.",NA,"SCOPUS","ECO-PHYSIOLOGY AND HABITAT INVASIBILITY OF AN INVASIVE, TROPICAL SHRUB (LANTANA CAMARA) IN WESTERN HIMALAYAN FORESTS OF INDIA","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84945458931&doi=10.1080%2f21580103.2014.990062&partnerID=40&md5=90c36175451fb62d7fe380e507dc8c7a","11",2015,"NA NA","DAV (PG) COLLEGE","NOTREPORTED;DAV (PG) COLLEGEINDIA",NA,"MANDAL G, 2015, FOR SCI TECHNOL","MANDAL G, 2015, FOR SCI TECHNOL"

GEOGR.","HIMALAYAN MOUNTAIN SYSTEM IN THE INDIAN SUB-CONTINENT ARE AMONG THE MOST ECOLOGICALLY SENSITIVE ENVIRONMENTS AND ARE ALSO A REPOSITORY OF BIODIVERSITY, WATER AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES, LAND TRANSFORMATION RELATED TO EXPLOITATIVE LAND USES IS AMONG THE MAIN DRIVERS OF CHANGING VEGETATION COVER AND PRODUCTIVITY IN WESTERN HIMALAYAS. IN A REGION WHERE FIELD BASED RESEARCH IS CHALLENGING DUE TO HETEROGENOUS RELIEF AND HIGH ALTITUDE, QUANTIFYING CHANGES IN VEGETATION PHOTOSYNTHETIC ACTIVITY USING REMOTE SENSING CAN PROVIDE ESSENTIAL INFORMATION REGARDING TRENDS IN VEGETATION COVER AND ITS LINKAGES WITH ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACTS. WE CONDUCTED SEASONAL TREND ANALYSIS (STA) ON MODIS NDVI TIME-SERIES DATA (2000-2014) OVER UTTARAKHAND HIMALAYAS AND EXAMINED SPATIO-TEMPORAL PATTERNS IN VEGETATION TRENDS AND ITS ASSOCIATION WITH ALTITUDINAL GRADIENT AND LAND USE LAND COVER (LULC) DYNAMICS. IN STA THE FIRST STEP DETERMINES THE ANNUAL MEAN AND SEASONAL NDVI PATTERNS AND THE SECOND STEP ANALYZES THE NON-PARAMETRIC TREND IN MAGNITUDE AND TIMING OF THE ANNUAL MEAN AND SEASONAL NDVI CYCLE. TO PROVIDE INSIGHTS ON THE ROLE OF CHANGING LAND USE TO DETECTED CHANGES IN VEGETATION TREND, WE LINKED MODIS DERIVED TRENDS TO LAND TRANSFORMATION PROCESSES USING MULTI-TEMPORAL HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION IMAGERY IN GOOGLE EARTH (GE). IN TOTAL 3286.82KM2 (6.9% VEGETATED AREA OF UTTARAKHAND) SHOWED SIGNIFICANT TREND (P&LT;0.01) IN MEAN ANNUAL GREENNESS. WHILE AREAS &LT;800M ELEVATION SHOWED DOMINANT NEGATIVE TREND IN MEAN ANNUAL GREENNESS (BROWNING)), THOSE BETWEEN 800 AND 1600M SHOWED MOSTLY POSITIVE TREND (GREENING) AND MAJORITY OF AREAS &GT;1600M WERE CHARACTERIZED BY NEGATIVE TREND IN MEAN ANNUAL GREENNESS. MAJORITY OF INTENSIVELY CULTIVATED IRRIGATED CROPLANDS IN THE HIMALAYAN FOOTHILLS AS WELL AS AREAS AROUND GROWING URBAN CENTERS SHOWED WIDESPREAD BROWNING, WHICH WAS CONTRASTINGLY DIFFERENT FROM RAINFED CULTIVATION AREAS THAT SHOWED DOMINANT GREENING TREND. BROWNING TREND WAS OBSERVED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH INCREASING ALTITUDE, PARTICULARLY IN CLOSED NEEDLE LEAF FORESTS AND ALPINE SHRUBLANDS, EXCEPT AREAS WHERE HUMAN IMPACTS HAS LED TO MORE MIXED PATTERNS. TRENDS IN THE ANNUAL SEASONAL TIMING OF NDVI INDICATED AN EARLIER GREEN-UP FOR MOST PARTS OF THE UTTARAKHAND HIMALAYAS. THESE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT FINE SCALE SPATIAL VARIATIONS IN SEASONAL VEGETATION TRENDS AND ARE IN PARTIAL AGREEMENT WITH PREVIOUS STUDIES THAT REPORT ONLY INCREASING BROWNNESS DETECTED AT BROADER SCALE USING MUCH COARSER SPATIAL RESOLUTION TIME-SERIES. 2014 ELSEVIER LTD.",NA,NA,NA,"MISHRA, N.B.; DEPARTMENT OF GEOGRAPHY AND THE ENVIRONMENT, THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTINUNITED STATES","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.apgeog.2014.10.007",NA,"01436228","APPLIED GEOGRAPHY","ENGLISH",36,NA,"29-41","ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"SCOPUS","SPATIO-TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF TRENDS IN SEASONAL VEGETATION PRODUCTIVITY ACROSS UTTARAKHAND, INDIAN HIMALAYAS, 2000-2014","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84910020598&doi=10.1016%2fj.apgeog.2014.10.007&partnerID=40&md5=0d05c9612e53c03681f1cd24f6d67d7a","56",2015,"NA NA","THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN;UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-LA CROSSE","NOTREPORTED;THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTINUNITED STATES",NA,"MISHRA NB, 2015, APPL GEOGR","MISHRA NB, 2015, APPL GEOGR"

IS SHRINKING IN DUN VALLEY DUE TO HABITAT FRAGMENTATION, INVASION BY LANTANA CAMARA, OVER-EXPLOITATION, AND AN EVER-INCREASING HUMAN POPULATION - THE MOST IMPORTANT BEING THE INCREASING DEMAND ON LAND FOR AGRICULTURE, INDUSTRIES AND THE URBANIZATION. PREDICTING POTENTIAL GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES IS IMPORTANT FROM SPECIES AND HABITAT RESTORATION POINT OF VIEW. THIS PAPER REPORTS THE RESULTS OF A STUDY CARRIED OUT IN THE LESSER HIMALAYAN FOOTHILLS IN INDIA (DUN VALLEY) ON POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION MODELING FOR MALABAR NUT USING MAXENT MODEL. THE WORLDCLIM BIOCLIMATIC VARIABLES, SLOPE, ASPECT, ELEVATION, AND THE LAND USE/LAND COVER (BASED ON IRS LISS-III) DATA AND 46 SPATIALLY WELL-DISPERSED SPECIES OCCURRENCE POINTS WERE USED TO PREDICT THE POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION OF J. ADHATODA IN CA. 1877KM2 STUDY AREA. JACKKNIFE TEST WAS USED TO EVALUATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES FOR PREDICTIVE MODELING. MAXENT MODEL WAS HIGHLY ACCURATE WITH A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AUC VALUE OF 92.3.

REMOTE SENS.","HYPTIS SUAVEOLENS (L.) POIT. IS AN ALIEN INVASIVE PLANT SPECIES IN THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT INTRODUCED FROM TROPICAL AMERICA, AND IS AN EMERGING INVADER OF THE HIMALAYAN FOOTHILLS. THIS STUDY DISCUSSES THE APPLICATION OF SPECTRAL UNMIXING TECHNIQUES FOR DETECTION AND DISCRIMINATION OF H. SUAVEOLENS INVASION AT SUB-PIXEL LEVEL IN THE DOON VALLEY AND SHIWALIK OF INDIA USING EARTH OBSERVATION 1 (EO-1) ADVANCED LAND IMAGER (ALI) SATELLITE DATA. MULTI-DATE SATELLITE IMAGES CORRESPONDING TO THE LIFE CYCLE OF H. SUAVEOLENS WERE PROCESSED FOR GEOMETRIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS. JEFFRIES-MATUSITA SPECTRAL SEPARABILITY ANALYSIS HELPED IN IDENTIFYING THE OPTIMAL PERIOD (I.E. LATE OCTOBER AND EARLY NOVEMBER) FOR BETTER DISCRIMINATION OF H. SUAVEOLENS. THE APPLIED ANALYSIS SPECTRAL ANALYTICAL PROCESS (AASAP)-BASED SPECTRAL UNMIXING OF ALI DATA DURING THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER DETECTED H. SUAVEOLENS COVER AS LOW AS 40-50% OF THE ALI PIXEL WITH A PRODUCER'S ACCURACY OF 76.67%. THE AREA PERCENTAGE ACCURACY FOR ABUNDANCE CLASS (40-50%) WAS 82.56%. THE INFORMATION ON INFESTED LOCALITIES IN THE STUDY AREA IS PRESENTED IN THE FORM OF A FRACTIONAL COVER MAP OF H. SUAVEOLENS OCCURRENCE. THE STUDY OUTCOMES HAVE SIGNIFICANCE IN UNDERSTANDING THE PATTERN OF INVASION SUCH AS DISPERSAL ROUTES, SEVERITY OF INFESTATION, CATEGORIES OF LAND USE AFFECTED, AND ITS MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT. 2013 TAYLOR & FRANCIS.",NA,NA,"IJSED","PADALIA, H.; REGIONAL REMOTE SENSING CENTRE-NORTH, , DEHRADUN 248001, INDIA; EMAIL: HITENPADALIA@GMAIL.COM","ARTICLE","10.1080/01431161.2012.714003",NA,"01431161","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING","ENGLISH",11,"1","325-340","TAYLOR AND FRANCIS LTD.",NA,"SCOPUS","MAPPING SUB-PIXEL OCCURRENCE OF AN ALIEN INVASIVE HYPTIS SUAVEOLENS (L.)

FORESTS ARE INNATELY ASSOCIATED TO HUMAN WELL-BEING. HOWEVER, WITH THE INCREASING ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITIES, DEFORESTATION HAS INCREASED. QUANTITATIVE CHANGE ANALYSIS OF THE FOREST COVER FOR THE PAST TWO DECADES PROVIDES VALUABLE INSIGHT INTO THE FOREST CONSERVATION VIS--VIS ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITIES IN THE REGION. SPATIO-TEMPORAL DATASETS ALONG WITH BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC VARIABLES PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO MODEL THE FOREST COVER CHANGE FURTHER. THE PRESENT STUDY INVESTIGATES FOREST COVER CHANGE AND PREDICTS STATUS OF FOREST COVER IN THE DEHRADUN FOREST DIVISION. LAND CHANGE MODELLER (LCM) WAS USED TO PREDICT STATUS OF FOREST COVER FOR 2010 AND 2015 USING CURRENT DISTURBANCE SCENARIOS. COMPARING ACTUAL LULC OF 2006 WITH THE PREDICTED LULC OF 2006 VALIDATED CHANGE PREDICTION MODEL AND AGREEMENT WAS 61. 03%. THE FORESTED AREAS ARE GETTING DEGRADED DUE TO ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITIES, BUT DEFORESTATION/DEGRADATION DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE MUCH IN EXPANDING URBAN AREA. AGRICULTURAL AREAS AND FALLOW LANDS ARE THE MAIN CONTRIBUTORS TO INCREASED URBAN AREA.

FOR. RES.","CLIMATE IS A CRITICAL FACTOR AFFECTING FOREST ECOSYSTEMS AND THEIR CAPACITY TO PRODUCE GOODS AND SERVICES. EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON FORESTS DEPEND ON ECOSYSTEM-SPECIFIC FACTORS INCLUDING DIMENSIONS OF CLIMATE (TEMPERATURE, PRECIPITATION, DROUGHT, WIND ETC.). AVAILABLE INFORMATION IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE ECOLOGICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES. THE PRESENT STUDY ASSESSED SHIFTS IN FOREST COVER TYPES OF WESTERN HIMALAYAN ECO-REGION (700-4500 M). 100 RANDOMLY SELECTED SAMPLES (75 FOR TRAINING AND 25 FOR TESTING THE MODEL), GENETIC ALGORITHM OF RULE SET PARAMETERS AND CLIMATIC ENVELOPES WERE USED TO ASSESS THE DISTRIBUTION OF FIVE PROMINENT FOREST COVER TYPES (TEMPERATE EVERGREEN, TROPICAL SEMI-EVERGREEN, TEMPERATE CONIFER, SUBTROPICAL CONIFER, AND TROPICAL MOIST DECIDUOUS FORESTS). MODELLING WAS CONDUCTED FOR FOUR DIFFERENT SCENARIOS, CURRENT SCENARIO, CHANGED PRECIPITATION (8% INCREASE), CHANGED TEMPERATURE (1. 07C INCREASE), AND BOTH CHANGED TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION. ON INCREASING PRECIPITATION A DOWNWARD SHIFT IN THE TEMPERATE EVERGREEN AND TROPICAL SEMI-EVERGREEN WAS OBSERVED, WHILE SUB-TROPICAL CONIFER AND TROPICAL MOIST-DECIDUOUS FORESTS SHOWED A SLIGHT UPWARD SHIFT AND TEMPERATE CONIFER SHOWED NO SHIFT. ON INCREASING TEMPERATURE, AN UPWARD SHIFT IN ALL FOREST TYPES WAS OBSERVED EXCEPT SUB-TROPICAL CONIFER FORESTS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES. WHEN BOTH TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION WERE CHANGED, THE ACTUAL DISTRIBUTION WAS MAINTAINED AND SLIGHT UPWARD SHIFT WAS OBSERVED IN ALL THE FOREST TYPES EXCEPT SUB-TROPICAL CONIFER. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE LIKELY IMPACTS OF THE PROJECTED CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE FOREST ECOSYSTEMS, SO THAT BETTER MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION STRATEGIES CAN BE ADOPTED FOR THE BIODIVERSITY AND FOREST DEPENDENT COMMUNITY. KNOWLEDGE OF IMPACT MECHANISMS ALSO ENABLES IDENTIFICATION AND MITIGATION OF SOME OF THE CONDITIONS THAT INCREASE VULNERABILITY TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE FOREST SECTOR. 2012 NORTHEAST FORESTRY UNIVERSITY AND SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN HEIDELBERG.",NA,NA,NA,"JOSHI, P.

SUCH CONTIGUITY CANNOT BE GUARANTEED WITHOUT PROVIDING A PATH OR 'A CORRIDOR' THROUGH FORESTED LANDSCAPES THAT INCLUDES NATURAL LAND COVER AND UNDISTURBED PATCHES. INCIDENTALLY, THE HIMALAYAN FOOTHILLS HAVE GREATER PRESSURE ON THESE LANDSCAPES DUE TO HIGH HUMAN DEPENDENCE FOR LIVELIHOOD. THIS PRESSURE IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE IN THE COMING YEARS ALTERING THE POTENTIAL CORRIDORS BETWEEN PAS. THE PA MANAGERS NEED FLEXIBLE PROCESSING, MODELING AND DECISION TOOLS TO PROPOSE A RANGE OF ACCEPTABLE CORRIDORS BETWEEN THE PAS AND ENSURE THEIR SUSTAINABLE HEALTH. SUCH FLEXIBLE TOOLS CAN BE UTILIZED IN FUTURE TO MODIFY FOR TAKING DECISION TO CONSERVE THE PATCHES CONNECTING PATCHES AND ADAPT AS PER CHANGING LANDSCAPES. THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES UTILITY OF GEOSPATIAL MODELING TOOLS TO ASSESS THE STATUS OF CORRIDORS IN LIGHT OF CHANGING LANDSCAPES BETWEEN RAJAJI AND JIM CORBETT NATIONAL PARK, THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT PAS IN THE HIMALAYAN FOOTHILLS. THE WORK HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT IN FOUR STAGES, FIRST-USING SATELLITE DATA LAND USE LAND COVER (LULC) MAPS WERE PREPARED FOR YEAR 1990, 2000 AND 2005, SECOND-LAND CHANGE MODELER (LCM) WAS USED FOR LULC CHANGE ANALYSIS, THIRD-MULTI LAYER PERCEPTRON NEURAL NETWORK (MLPNN) WAS USED TO PREDICT THE STATUS OF LULC FOR 2015 AND 2020, AND FOURTH-USING TEMPORAL MORPHOLOGY OF THE AREAS BEHAVING BOTH AS BARRIER AND EASINESS, FRICTION SURFACE COST WAS CALCULATED TO IDENTIFY LEAST COST PATHWAYS (LCPS)/MIGRATORY CORRIDORS BETWEEN THE PAS. THE LULC MAPS FOR 1990, 2000 AND 2005 WERE EVALUATED USING ACCURACY ASSESSMENT (80%) AND KHAT STATISTICS (>0.79). THE CHANGE PREDICTION MODEL WAS VALIDATED BY COMPARING ACTUAL LULC OF 2005 WITH PREDICTED LULC OF 2005 AND THE AGREEMENT WAS 71%. THE LCP HAS SHIFTED WITH THE PREDICTED CHANGE IN THE CLASSES.

QUANTIFICATION OF LANDSCAPE PATTERN USING LANDSCAPE METRICS HELP IN CHARACTERISATION OF LANDSCAPES AND THUS OVERALL HEALTH OF THE FOREST COVER. HIMALAYAN FOOTHILLS ARE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND FRAGILE LANDSCAPES. DEVELOPMENTAL ACTIVITIES AND DEPDENDENCE ON THE FOREST RESOURCES HAVE ALTERED THE SPATIAL PATTERN OF THESE NATURAL LANDSCAPES TO A GREAT EXTENT. THESE CHANGES IN THE LANDSCAPE WERE ANALYSED USING SATELLITE DATA FROM 1990, 2001 AND 2006. THE VEGETATION TYPE MAPS OF DEHRADUN FOREST DIVISION WERE PREPARED BY SUPERVISED CLASSIFICATION TECHNIQUE IN ORDER TO STUDY THE LANDSCAPE DYNAMICS. PATCH DENSITY, EDGE DENSITY, SHAPE INDEX, COHESION INDEX, INTERSPERSION AND JUXTAPOSITION INDEX, NORMALISED ENTROPY, AND RELATIVE RICHNESS ARE SOME IMPORTANT LANDSCAPE METRICS USED IN THE STUDY FOR QUANTIFYING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF LANDSCAPE. THE LANDSCAPE METRICS ANALYSIS AND TRANSFORMATION ANALYSIS SHOW THAT THE FORESTED AREAS ARE GETTING DEGRADED AND PHYSICAL CONNECTEDNESS BETWEEN THE PATCHES HAVE ALSO DECREASED MAKING THEM ISOLATED.

CLAY CONTENT WAS THE HIGHEST IN SOILS OF FOREST PROFILES, FOLLOWED BY THOSE UNDER CULTIVATED UNMANAGED AND WELL-MANAGED PROFILES, AND LEAST IN SOILS OF BARREN LAND PROFILES. SOILS OF BARREN LANDS SHOWED THE HIGHEST VALUES OF BULK DENSITY (1.47 TO 1.60 G CM-3), FOLLOWED BY CULTIVATED UNMANAGED (1.46 TO 1.58 G CM-3), CULTIVATED WELL-MANAGED LANDS (1.34 TO 1.54 G CM-3), AND LEAST IN THOSE OF FOREST LANDS (1.32 TO 1.52 G CM-3). THE VALUES OF PARTICLE DENSITY DECREASED IN THE ORDER: BARREN LANDS (2.57 TO 2.68 G CM-3) &GT; CULTIVATED UNMANAGED (2.52 TO 2.67 G CM-3) &GT; CULTIVATED WELL-MANAGED (2.44 TO 2.62 G CM-3) &GT; FOREST LANDS (2.38 TO 2.62 G CM-3). SOILS OF FOREST LANDS HAD GENERALLY HIGHER VALUES OF PORE SPACE (41.4 TO 47.2 %) FOLLOWED BY CULTIVATED WELL-MANAGED LANDS (41.4 TO 45.1%), BARREN (40.1 TO 43.4%) AND UNMANAGED CULTIVATED LANDS (40.0 TO 43.2%).

J. REMOTE SENS.","THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EVALUATE THE UTILITY OF DIFFERENT INDIAN REMOTE SENSING SENSORS FOR DETECTION, MAPPING AND PATCH SIZE ESTIMATION OF LANTANA CAMARA L. (KURRI). THE LATTER, OF THE FAMILY VERBINACEAE, IS ONE OF THE MOST AGGRESSIVE INVASIVE PLANT SPECIES AND HAS COLONIZED LARGE AREAS OF FOREST LAND IN THE HIMALAYAN FOOTHILLS (SHIWALIK RANGE). THE STATE FOREST DEPARTMENTS OF INDIA ARE PLANNING TO DEVELOP A SUITABLE STRATEGY TO HALT ITS INVASION. THE FIRST STEP IN THIS DIRECTION IS TO HAVE ACCURATE INFORMATION ON THE LOCATION AND SPREAD OF THE PLANT IN SPATIAL FORMAT. THE TEST SITE IS PART OF THE FOREST OF THE RAJAJI NATIONAL PARK, UTTARAKHAND. INDIAN REMOTE SENSING-LINEAR IMAGING SELF-SCANNING SENSOR (IRS-LISS) III (MULTI-SPECTRAL, 23.5 M), IRS-LISS IV (MULTI-SPECTRAL, 5.8 M), CARTOSAT-1 (PANCHROMATIC, 2.5 M) AND A MERGED IMAGE OF LISS IV AND CARTOSAT-1 USING BROVEY FUSION TECHNIQUES WERE USED TO MAP LANTANA CAMARA L. FURTHER IMPROVEMENT WAS OBTAINED USING TEXTURE ANALYSIS. THE STUDY DEMONSTRATES THE POTENTIALITY OF LISS IV AND CARTOSAT-1 DATA FOR DETECTION AND MAPPING OF LANTANA CAMARA L. THE RESULTS SHOW THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING A SEMI-AUTOMATED PROCEDURE TO MAP AND ANALYSE THE DISTRIBUTION OF LANTANA IN FOREST AREAS. 2010 TAYLOR & FRANCIS.",NA,NA,"IJSED","DASARI, A.; EFD/AFEG/RESA, , AHMEDABAD-380 015, GUJARAT, INDIA; EMAIL: ANITHAISRO@YAHOO.CO.IN","ARTICLE","10.1080/01431160903121126",NA,"01431161","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING","ENGLISH",25,"12","3273-3289","TAYLOR AND FRANCIS LTD.",NA,"SCOPUS","METHODOLOGY TO MAP THE SPREAD OF AN INVASIVE PLANT (LANTANA CAMARA L.)

PALAEOECOL.","CARBON ISOTOPE RATIO OF EARLY DIAGENETIC CARBONATE CEMENT (EDCC) FROM SANDSTONES WAS MEASURED FROM MOHAND RAO (AGE: 9 TO 4.5 MA) AND HARIPUR KHOL (6 TO 1.8 MA) SECTIONS OF SIWALIK GROUP OF INDIA TO RECONSTRUCT PALAEOVEGETATION. THE 13C OF CEMENT FROM MOHAND RAO SECTION VARIES FROM - 10.5 TO - 0.2 WITH PROGRESSIVE INCREASE IN VALUES FROM 9 TO 7.3 MA INDICATING GRADUAL CHANGE OF EXISTING C3 TYPE VEGETATION TO C 4 TYPE VEGETATION. POST 7.3 MA, THE 13C VALUE IS ANCHORED AROUND ZERO PER MIL INDICATING MIXED C3-C4 ENVIRONMENT WITH C4 DOMINATING THE ECOSYSTEM. IN HARIPUR KHOL SECTION, THE 13C VALUE OF EDCC FROM SANDSTONE INDICATES PRESENCE OF BOTH C3 AND C4 TYPE OF PLANTS WITH DOMINANCE OF C4 IN THE ECOSYSTEM, WHICH CORROBORATES THE RESULTS OF OUR PREVIOUS STUDY BASED ON CARBON ISOTOPE RATIO OF SOIL CARBONATES. THE OXYGEN ISOTOPE RATIO OF EDCC FROM SANDSTONES DOES NOT SHOW ANY SYSTEMATIC VARIATION WITH TIME. THE 18O VALUES OF EDCC FROM MOHAND RAO SECTION RANGES FROM - 8.9 TO - 13.6 AND IN HARIPUR KHOL SECTION, FROM - 9.9 TO - 13.6. AT A GIVEN STRATIGRAPHIC LEVEL, THE AVERAGE 18O VALUE OF EDCC OF SANDSTONES IS LOWER (UP TO 4) COMPARED TO THE AVERAGE 18O OF SOIL CARBONATE FROM THE SAME OR ADJACENT LEVEL (USING OUR EARLIER PUBLISHED DATA FROM HARIPUR KHOL SECTION). THE DEPLETION IN 18O OF EDCC MAY BE DUE TO CONTRIBUTION OF CONTEMPORARY RIVER WATER INFILTRATING THE GROUNDWATER SYSTEM IN THE POST-MONSOON PERIOD. CARBON AND OXYGEN ISOTOPE RATIO OF SOIL CARBONATE NODULES AND CARBON ISOTOPE RATIO OF ASSOCIATED ORGANIC MATTER FROM THE SAME NODULES WERE ALSO MEASURED FROM THE MOHAND RAO SECTION IN A FEW CASES (N = 9). FROM 9 TO 8 MA, THE CARBON ISOTOPE RATIO OF SOIL CARBONATES VARIES FROM - 10.8 TO - 7.8 INDICATING DOMINANCE OF C3 TYPE VEGETATION IN THE FLOOD PLAIN. IN CONTRAST, FROM 5.4 TO 4.8 MA, THE 13C RANGES FROM 0.1 TO - 4.3 INDICATING THAT THE VEGETATION CONSISTED OF MIXED C3-C4 PLANTS WITH C4 DOMINATING THE ECOSYSTEM. THE CARBON ISOTOPE RATIO OF THE ORGANIC MATTER FROM THE SAME SOIL CARBONATE NODULES RANGES FROM - 25.2 TO - 24.4 (FROM 9 TO 8 MA) AND - 17.4 TO - 24.6 (FROM 5.4 TO 4.8 MA) CORROBORATING THE ABOVE RESULTS. THE AVERAGE 18O VALUE OF SOIL CARBONATE NODULES FOR THE TIME PERIOD 9 TO 8 MA IS - 8.8; FOR 5.4 TO 4.8 MA, THE VALUE IS - 7.9. THESE AVERAGE 18O VALUES ARE COMPARABLE WITH PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED OXYGEN ISOTOPE RESULTS OF SOIL CARBONATES FROM HARIPUR KHOL AND KANGRA VALLEY. 2005 ELSEVIER B.V.

RICHNESS OF WOODY SPECIES, IMPORTANCE VALUE INDEX (IVI) OF TREES, AND REGENERATION OF SAL (SHOREA ROBUSTA GAERTN.), THE CLIMAX SPECIES OF THE REGION, HAVE BEEN COMPARED. BASED ON 'TWINSPAN' ANALYSIS 17 GROUPS OR TREE ASSOCIATIONS WERE SEGREGATED WITH EIGEN VALUES RANGING FORM 0.216 TO 0.729 WHICH LARGELY FOLLOW INCREASING RAINFALL AND MOISTURE GRADIENT. ABSENCE OF ANOGEISSUS LATIFOLIA IN THE OUTER HIMALAYA MARKED THE DIFFERENCE FROM THE TREE ASSOCIATIONS OF OTHER TWO ZONES. THE RICHNESS OF WOODY SPECIES WAS HIGHEST IN SHIVALIKS (62) FOLLOWED BY DOON VALLEY (56) AND OUTER HIMALAYA (54). OF 1001 INDIVIDUALS OF SAL MEASURED FOR GBH, THE POLE SIZE (10-20 CM GIRTH CLASS FORMED ABOUT 4% OF THE POPULATION. OUTER HIMALAYA HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER DENSITY OF SAL SAPLINGS (&LT; 10 CM GIRTH CLASS) COMPARED TO SHIVALIKS (PAIRED T = 2.62 P &LT; 0.05) AND DOON VALLEY (T = 2.29 P &LT; 0.05) BUT THE LATTER TWO ZONES WERE SIMILAR IN SAPLING DENSITIES. SAL ATTAINED HIGHEST GIRTH IN DOON VALLEY (X = 126.2 12.3 CM) AND LOWEST IN THE OUTER HIMALAYA (X = 56.0 6.4 CM). WITHIN SHIVALIKS THE TREE DENSITIES (HA-1) VARIED AMONG VALLEY BOTTOM (260.9 64.1), MIDDLE SLOPE (265.7 77.9) AND SHIVALIK RIDGE (254.6 100.7). HOWEVER, TREE DENSITIES IN DOON VALLEY (640.0 253.9 HA-1) AND OUTER HIMALAYA (643.7 257.7 HA-1) WERE MUCH HIGHER COMPARED TO SHIVALIKS. AREAS DISTURBED DUE TO LOPPING AND CUTTING, PARTICULARLY IN DOON VALLEY AND OUTER HIMALAYA WERE DOMINATED BY LANTANA CAMARA LINN., AN EXOTIC SHRUB. THOUGH LANTANA THICKETS SEEM TO PROTECT SAL SEEDLINGS FROM THE FROST AND OTHER INJURIES, OVERALL PLANT SPECIES DIVERSITY WAS VERY LOW IN SUCH AREAS.

THE POSSIBLE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE EXOTIC SPECIES AND THE ALREADY EXISTING NATURALISED SPECIES OR NATIVES NEEDS TO BE QUANTIFIED BEFORE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MASSIVE PLANTATIONS TAKES PLACE. THIS SET OF MIXTURE TRIALS INVOLVED EVALUATION OF INTRA- AND INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION BETWEEN AND WITHIN FAST GROWING LEUCAENA LEUCOCEPHALA (EXOTIC) WITH THE RELATIVELY SLOW GROWING ACACIA NILOTICA (INDIGENOUS). AN EVEN AGED MIXED PLANTATION IN A HEXAGONAL ARRANGEMENT WITH VARYING PROPORTIONS OF THE TWO SPECIES AROUND AN INDICATOR OR TEST TREE WAS RAISED. PERIODICAL OBSERVATIONS REVEALED THE QUANTITATIVE CHANGES IN TREE GROWTH BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE SERIAL MANIPULATION OF THE NEIGHBOURS OF THE INDICATOR TREE. IN ALL THE COMBINATIONS, LEUCAENA EXHIBITED PROFUSE HEIGHT GROWTH, STEADY DIAMETER INCREASE, DENSE CANOPY AND A HIGH WOOD VOLUME.
