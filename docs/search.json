    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nThe Himalayas is the younger most mountain system of the world which can be divided into the greater Himalayas, the lesser Himalayas and the outer Himalayas depending on the average elevations (Burrard and Hayden 1907; Wadia 1944). The outer Himalayas or the southernmost foothills of the Himalayas, ranging from elevations of 600-1200 m are also referred as the ‘Siwaliks’ (Bose 1972; Burrard and Hayden 1907; Wadia 1944). These hills are distributed parallel to the Himalayan hills from the Brahmaputra valley to the Potwar Plateau of Pakistan (Krishnan 1943) and cover the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Assam (Yadav et al. 2015). The distribution of Siwaliks in North-western region of India is depicted in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The geographic distribution of the Siwaliks in the North-western region of India. Data were acquired from the Bhukosh portal of the Geological Survey of India (http://bhukosh.gsi.gov.in/)\n\n\n\n\nHowever, available evidence indicate that the Siwaliks were formed during the upper Miocene to Pliocene epoch and are chiefly consist of clay, sandstones and conglomerates (Vredenburg 1910; Bose 1972). This region is well-known for its rich vertebrate faunal deposits, indicating that a rich diversity of plants would have supported these animals (Wadia 1944). The silicified wood or the whole tree trunks can be found in sandstones, whereas leaf impressions in shales of the same region were also reported, which supports the abundance of vegetation (Vredenburg 1910; Wadia 1944). However, the literature indicates large inconsistencies in the spelling use while describing these foothills and as many as four spelling variants viz. Siwalik (Cautley 1839; Shukla and Bora 2019), Shiwalik (Batra and Batra 1963; Kaur et al. 2019), Shivalik (Campbell 1879; Kumar and Sankhyan 2019) and Sivalik (Asiatic Society of Bengal 1836; Ghosh 2016) are used. These inconsistencies are not prevalent only in scientific literature, but also exist in the non-scientific literature such as various governmental reports of India (like the annual reports of the ministry of environment forest and climate change, MoEFCC; The Project Tiger, Forest Survey of India, Zoological Survey of India, etc.), Gazettes of India (The Gazette of India and its States, Encyclopaedias (Editors of the Columbia Encyclopedia 2019; Editors of the Encyclopaedia Brittanica 2011) and dictionaries (Lexico Dictionaries 2019). Therefore, it is imperative to resolve these conflicts of the spelling usages, so as to maintain uniformity and avoid any confusions in the future. Here, we have addressed this issue by providing evidence through vote counting approach (i.e. the total number of publications for each spelling variant) and years of publications so as to track their origin and abundance in the literature."

    "text": "Results and Discussion\nThe results of the vote count approach from different databases have indicated the dominance of the term Siwalik and the distribution pattern of these terms is shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The distribution of Spelling variants (in the title of publications) among different scientific databases\n\n\n\n\nEach selected database depicted the same pattern i.e. the term ‘Siwalik’ was most dominant whereas the term ‘Sivalik’ was least represented. On the other hand, the terms ‘Shivalik’ and ‘Shiwalik’ were more or less equally represented. Further, the annual production of published articles in the Scopus and Web of Science database has revealed that the number of publications with term ‘Siwalik’ has exponentially increased, whereas it is only during the past two decades when the usage of the terms ‘Shivalik’ and ‘Shiwalik’ has become more frequent (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The trend of annual scientific production of publications with spelling variants from both the Scopus and Web of Science database. The smooth lines were fitted using the loess (y ~ x) method\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the analysis of Scopus and Web of Science database revealed that the term ‘Siwalik’ was the oldest term (1878) which has increased rapidly and continues to increase, but the term ‘Shivalik’ (1955) and ‘Shiwalik’ (1973) were relatively recent terms which are increasing only during the recent decades. Another term ‘Sivalik’ is also one of the oldest terms (1880) but the usage of this term has been diminished during the past decades (Figure 3). However, a more extensive survey of available literature from other sources (Internet Archive and Biodiversity Heritage Library) suggested that the term ‘Sivalik’ was the oldest term and first appeared in 1836 (Asiatic Society of Bengal 1836). Though the usage of the term ‘Siwalik’ can be traced from 1528 A. D. in memoirs of the Emperor Babar (Burrard and Hayden 1907), the term was first introduced to scientific literature in 1839 by Capt. P. T. Cautley (a palaeontologist) and Hugh Falconer (a geologist and botanist) of the East India Company, who surveyed the hills located near to the Haridwar a pilgrimage site dedicated to Lord Shiva, therefore, the hills were termed as -― Siwalik hills (Cautley 1839; Sorkhabi 2010). Similarly, the term ‘Shivalik’ seems to be first introduced by J. P. Campbell in 1879 while describing his observations on the Glacial period from India (Campbell 1879) and this term seems to be second most frequently used term in modern literature. Further, the term ‘Shiwalik’ was first observed in 1963 while describing the Discomycetes fungi from the region (Batra and Batra 1963). Thus, the term ‘Sivalik’ was the oldest followed by ‘Siwalik’ and ‘Shivalik’ whereas the term ‘Shiwalik’ is the most recently used term. The dominance of the term ‘Siwalik’ may be due to its popularity, widespread use and is one of the oldest terms. All these terms are inspired by Lord Shiva, but it is the perception of author and subsequent translation into English which may have caused the observed variations in the spellings. Most of the early researchers who explored the area were non-native foreigners (from Britain, USA, etc.) and they named this hilly region according to their perception. That’s why the terms ‘Siwalik’ and ‘Sivalik’ were prevalent during the past century. However, the Indian authors have explored the region only during the past 4-5 decades, and they have introduced the terms ‘Shiwalik’ and ‘Shivalik’ referring to its correct translation.\nThe origin of these terms across countries was evaluated by analysing the ten most frequent countries with the corresponding author in their publications with different terms. The distribution of these terms across countries is represented in Figure 4.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The distribution of terms in the countries of the corresponding author\n\n\n\n\nThe variation of spellings of these terms is most commonly originates from India and therefore the publications from the country India are most diverse in the use of these terms. However, some countries like China, France, Germany, Nepal and Thailand have also used different spelling variants whereas other countries have used either of the spelling consistently. Since a large part of these foothills is shared by India; therefore, the country has the greatest number of publications mentioning these terms. The distribution of these terms across the top ten most relevant sources (like Journals, Books, etc.) is represented in Figure 5 and these spelling variants were prevalent within some journals like Annals of Agri Bio Research, Current Science, Indian Journal of Agricultural Sciences, Indian Journal of Ecology, Journal of Human Evolution, Nature and Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology. But this variation is less prominent in the Web of Science as compared to Scopus (Figure 5).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The distribution of terms in the top 10 most relevant sources of publications (Journals, Books, etc.) for each term in Scopus and Web of Science database\n\n\n\n\nIt has been further observed that the term ‘Siwalik’ was most consistently used in the fields of Geosciences and related fields which is still in practice. On the other hand, almost all the terms were used interchangeably in agricultural and biological sciences or other fields.

However, the term ‘Shivalik’ can also be considered as a correct translation based on the pilgrimage site dedicated to Lord Shiva. Therefore, keeping subject-specific usage of terms in the view, we suggest that the authors from the geosciences should consistently use the term ‘Siwalik’ (as most of them are following the same) whereas other fields including agricultural and biological sciences should use the term ‘Shivalik’ instead of ‘Shiwalik’ or ‘Sivalik’. Hence, the authors from India and neighbouring countries, who are most actively engaged in scientific research in this region and frequently use these terms should take care to adopt any one of the above terms consistently. Similarly, the editors and publishers from the related fields are also requested to look for the consistency of the usage of a specific term in their respective Journals or publications."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe Himalayan foothills or the Siwaliks have been considered as one of the most fragile ecosystems of India. The underlying cause of degradation includes natural settings (geological formation and climate change) and human-mediated pressures (sandstone mining, urbanisation and developmental activities). Since the Siwaliks is associated with the livelihood of about 20 million people, it becomes imperative to respond appropriately for sustaining this ecologically fragile region. Ecological principles have great potential to develop sustainable practices for the conservation and management of natural resources. These principles offer nature-based solutions to sustain the ecologically sensitive and degraded ecosystems such as the ‘Siwaliks’. However, there is a need for concerted research to develop data-driven decisions for effective management. Therefore, a systematic analysis was conducted to assess the current patterns and knowledge gaps about plant ecological studies in the Indian Siwalik region. This article analysed the available peer-reviewed literature using established guidelines and bibliometric analyses. We found an increasing trend in the scientific output, and most studies were concentrated in the Siwalik region belonging to the Indian state of Uttarakhand. Although studies have been conducted on plant ecology, landscape ecology and ecosystem ecology have been disproportionately focused. Our findings suggest a growing interest in the plant ecology of the region; however, these studies seem relatively small compared to the complexity and diversity of this ecosystem structural and functional attributes. Further, with advances in computer application and remote sensing satellite data availability, we observed a shift towards ecological modelling studies, though experimental evidence also needs to be addressed.\nKeywords: Himalayan foothills, Northwest Himalaya, Shivalik, Sivalik, Shiwalik, Uttarakhand"

    "text": "Introduction\nThe southernmost foothills of the Himalayas with an average elevation of 900–1200 m are known as Siwaliks (Wadia 1944) or other spelling variants (A. Kumar, Patil, and Singh 2020). This younger range of the Himalayas is characterised by rich fossil remains of vertebrates, plants, and molluscs (Dhital 2015). Geographically, these hills run parallel to the Himalayas from the Potwar Plateau of Pakistan to Brahmaputra valley in India (Wadia 1944; Dhital 2015). It is well developed in India’s northwest region and covers a 3.33 Mha area across six Indian states and a union territory (Yadav et al. 2015). The Siwalik landscape supports a rich diversity of flora (Rout and Gupta 1989; A. Singh, Reddy, and Singh 1995; Rawat and Bhainsora 1999) and fauna (Sivakumar, Sathyakumar, and Rawat 2010). Apart from biological and geological importance, the present region also harbours culturally diverse human population whose livelihood depends on the region’s natural resources. However, the Siwaliks have been degrading due to inevitable pressure from human activities (e.g., mining, industrialisation and more urban expansion) and climate change (Tewari, Verma, and Gadow 2017). These human-mediated disturbances and geological settings make the region fragile, leading to frequent landslides and soil erosion. Soil erosion has remained a persistent problem of the region despite numerous efforts for management (Scott and Walter 1993; Semwal, Khobragade, and Nainwal 2017). Considering the unprecedented ecological degradation, Indian Siwalik has been once proposed to be declared as a biosphere reserve (Press Trust of India 2010). Such initiatives to sustain and preserve threatened landscapes can be supported by knowledge derived from ecological studies.\nPlant ecology focuses on the interactions of plants (primarily terrestrial plants) with their environments over a range of spatio-temporal scales (Gurevitch, Scheiner, and Fox 2002). The interests and focus of plant ecologists varied over time from community ecology, population ecology, physiological ecology, ecosystem ecology, species interactions, landscape ecology to macroecology (Gurevitch, Scheiner, and Fox 2002). Despite substantial growth and development of the field, many mysteries of nature are neither well-known nor fully understood (Schulze et al. 2019). For instance, human activities and climate change have been rapidly altering the interactions of organisms with their environment; yet their consequences are not fully known (Schulze et al. 2019). These alterations in nature can considerably threaten the balance of organisms and their environment. Thus, studying ecological interactions becomes important to sustainably manage natural resources and ensure continuity of life on the earth.\nResearch synthesis is crucial to integrate past findings and develop a future roadmap for research (Koricheva and Gurevitch 2013). Traditional narrative synthesis and vote count approaches of literature reviews often suffer from bias and lack replicability (Koricheva and Gurevitch 2013). Modern research synthesis employs a well-defined methodology for literature review to answer specific questions to overcome these constraints. Although systematic reviews have been frequently used in medical sciences, the same is also being applied in ecology and evolution. Systematic reviews aim to answer precise questions, whereas a systematic map aims to describe the field (James, Randall, and Haddaway 2016; CEE 2018). On the other hand, bibliometrics measure scientific articles’ influence and relationships based on statistical methods (Aria and Cuccurullo 2017). Therefore, bibliometrics has been contemporarily included in review articles (Xie et al. 2020; Rodríguez-Soler, Uribe-Toril, and De Pablo Valenciano 2020; Rishikesh Singh et al. 2021; Verma, Kumari, and Raghubanshi 2021). Recently, a new framework of research synthesis called “research weaving” combines the systematic map and bibliometric approaches (Nakagawa et al. 2019). Thus, the research weaving approach describes and summarises the evidence and visualises the influence and relationships among the evidence (Nakagawa et al. 2019).\nConsidering the importance of plant ecology and ecological problems of the Indian Siwaliks, this review aims to describe the focus of plant ecological studies by analysing the current evidence from the bibliometric analysis. Further, we aim to identify the patterns and gaps in the current knowledge, guiding future investigations. The taxonomic scope of this review is any plant species in the Siwaliks of northwest India. The Siwalik region has been spatially defined according to the Geological Survey of India (https://bhukosh.gsi.gov.in/Bhukosh/MapViewer.aspx). However, this study will not focus on agroecological aspects; therefore, studies concentrating on agricultural systems will be beyond the scope of this review. Overall, we aim to answer the following questions: (1) What are the focus areas of plant ecological studies conducted in the Indian Siwaliks? (2) What is the geographical and temporal distribution of the studies? (3) What are the research gaps and opportunities for future investigations?"

    "text": "Methodology\nWe adopted the guidelines and recommendations established by Collaboration for Environmental Evidence (CEE) for evidence synthesis in environmental management (CEE 2018). These recommendations are designed to improve the transparency and reproducibility of reviews in environmental contexts (CEE 2018; Grames and Elphick 2020). We departed from recommended practices as we neither consulted stakeholders nor registered a protocol. A review team comprising of individuals with relevant skills and knowledge (subject and methodological) was framed. The roles and responsibilities of each participant have been defined during the initial project development. Every weekend, we organised meetings and discussions to develop the protocol, search strategy, screening, data extraction, analyses, and writing. The selection of appropriate studies for the present review involved three phases: searching, screening, and inclusion (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Schematic flow diagram for literature search, screening and inclusion process (modified from Haddaway et al. 2017)\n\n\n\n\nLiterature database\nScopus (https://scopus.com/) and Web of Science Core Collection (https://webofknowledge.com/) are the most reliable databases for retrieval of high-quality peer-reviewed scientific literature in the fields of science and technology. Although the Web of Science Core Collection consists of seven indices: (i) Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), (ii) Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), (iii) Arts & Humanities Citation Index (AHCI), (iv) Conference Proceedings Citation Index (CPCI), (v) Book Citation Index (BCI), (vi) Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI), and (vii) Current Chemical Reactions and Index Chemicus (https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/web-of-science-core-collection/), our institution provided us access to SCIE, SSCI and AHCI for the timespan 1989-present. Both databases allow to export bibliographic meta-data offer great accuracy and reproducibility of literature search. However, access to these databases required a subscription through payment of large money. Although both databases emerged in 2004, Scopus offers relatively larger coverage of scientific literature whereas Web of Science provides offers coverage from early 1900.\nOn the other hand, Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/) is freely available and has most comprehensive coverage as it offers retrieval of most obscure information. Although it also provides access to full text articles, it is not a bibliographic database. Its content is dynamic and has compromised accuracy. Further, it lacks several functionalities in literature search like subject filtering and tagging. Considering these limitations, we limited our literature search to two bibliographic databases of peer-reviewed literature (Web of Science Core Collection and Scopus).\n\n\nSearch strings\nWe identified the terms that are frequently applied to the region using a preliminary literature search and discussion with review team members (Table 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: List of keywords used for developing search string\n\n\ngroup1\ngroup2\ngroup3\ngroup4\n\n\n\n\nshivalik\nhimalayan foothills\njammu hills\ndudhwa range\n\n\nsivalik\nouter himalayas\nkangra hills\ndundwa range\n\n\nshiwalik\nsub himalayas\nmorni hills\n\n\n\nsiwalik\n\nmohand hills\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther, we searched for various spelling variants of terms applied to the region (A. Kumar, Patil, and Singh 2020). Using a combination of these terms with boolean operators, we developed the following common search string for Web of Science and Scopus.\n\n(shivalik OR sivalik OR shiwalik OR siwalik) OR (himalaya* AND (foothill* OR outer OR sub)) OR (hill* AND (jammu OR kangra OR morni OR mohand)) OR (range* AND (dudhwa OR dundwa))\n\n\n\nLiterature search\n\nScopus: We have queried the above defined search string to the “Article title, Abstract, Keywords” in “Documents” using the default options for “Limit” (Date range (inclusive): Published from “All years” to “Present”; Document type: “ALL”). This query returned a total of 4,102 document results on 03 April 2021. Then, we have filtered the results by limiting subject to “Agricultural and Biological Sciences” and “Environmental Science” subject areas, which yielded a total of 1,875 documents. All these documents were selected by choosing “Select All” option and then exported all information by selecting “Citation information”, “Bibliographical information”, “Abstract & keywords”, “Funding details” and “Other information” in the BibTex format.\nWeb of Science Core Collection: The same keyword combination was queried in the “Topic” field of Web of Science by selecting the database “Web of Science Core Collection”. Default settings (Web of Science Core Collection: Citation Indexes - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) –1989-present, Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) –1989-present, and Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI) –1989-present; Auto-suggest publication names: On; and Default Number of Search Fields to Display: 1 field (Topic)) were used under the more settings option. This yielded us 2,978 results on 03 April 2021. Then the results were refined by selecting following Web of Science categories: ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, PLANT SCIENCES, PALEONTOLOGY, ECOLOGY, BIOLOGY, REMOTE SENSING, SOIL SCIENCE, BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION, FORESTRY, EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY, and ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES. This yielded a total of 1,013 results. Then the “Show” option was changed from “10 per page” (Default) to “50 per page”. Next, all entries on a page were first selected using the “Select Page” option and then added to “Marked List” using the “Add to Marked List” button. This was repeated for all the 21 pages and thus all the 1,103 entries were added to the “Marked List”. Since Web of Science allows export of 500 records at time, we have first selected the first 500 records by defining the record range “Records: 1 to 500” under the “Step 1: Select records.” option. Then we have selected all the fields using the “Select All” option under “Step 2: Select content. Select from the fields below:” option. Next, we have exported the records in BibTex format using the “Export” option under the “Step 3: Select destination.” And then choosing the “BibTex” option under the “Other File Formats”. The same process was repeated for records 501 to 1,000 and 1,001 to 1,013.\n\n\n\nArticle screening\nArticle screening was implemented in the R programming environment (R Core Team 2020) using the package revtools version 0.4.1 (Westgate 2019). This phase included de-duplication, title screening, abstract screening, and full-text screening. We adhered to the previously proposed eligibility criteria for the article screening phase (Table 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Eligibility criteria for inclusion or exclusion of studies\n\n\nCriteria\n\n\n\n\nInclusion\n\n\narticles falling in general scope of plant ecology\n\n\nstudy sites or their part situated within the boundary of Siwaliks\n\n\nstudies involving plants as one of the component\n\n\nstudies related to plant distributions and their interactions with environment\n\n\nstudies involving ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, and biomass production\n\n\nstudies referring to palaeoecological studies such as fossil distribution and past vegetation\n\n\nExclusion\n\n\nstudies concerning animals, fungi, microbes or any organism other than plants\n\n\nstudies focusing agroecosystems and agricultural practices\n\n\nstudies related to ethnobotanical or traditional uses of plants\n\n\nstudies evaluating phytochemicals or biological activities\n\n\nstudies focusing cytology, genetics or molecular biology of plants\n\n\nstudies reporting discovery of new species\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDe-duplication: Database may have erroneous duplications or due to automated information extraction systems. Thus, the documents can be largely duplicated within and across literature databases. These duplicates might waste the energy and time of the reviewers apart from erroneous results of reviews. Therefore, removal of duplicates is necessary. Several procedures and software are available for automated de-duplication of literature. Here, we have first de-duplicated the documents based on doi (digital object identifier) of each articles. Then, we have de-duplicated by matching title of each article. However, the upper- or lower case and punctuations can interfere with title matching. Therefore, we converted titles to lower case and removed punctuations before matching. Thus, after de-duplication we are left with 2,171 (unique doi = 2,366, unique doi + unique title = 2,171) articles out of total 2,888 articles (Figure 1). After this, we have performed manual screening of duplicates, if remained any.\nTitle screening: After de-duplication of articles, we performed article screening based on their titles. We have hidden every other information during title screening to avoid any potential bias. We assigned one of three labels to each article (i) selected, (ii) excluded, or (iii) unknown. We excluded 1,796 articles based on title screen and remaining 375 articles were selected for abstract screening out of which 158 articles were assigned “selected” and 217 articles were assigned “unknown” during the title screening. Next, we removed the articles assigned as “excluded” and screened for abstracts.\nAbstract screening: Our abstract screening resulted in exclusion of 264 articles and we are left with only 111 articles. Then we filtered these 111 articles and saved as the included articles (Figure 1).\nFull-text searching: Then we searched for full text for every article from publisher’s website, Google Scholar, Research Gate and institutional repositories. We were not able to retrieve full text of following 11 articles. We excluded these 11 articles and screened full text of articles.\n\nDevi, B., Bhardwaj, D. R., Panwar, P., Pal, S., Gupta, N.

Then, we manually screened articles based on the full-text of every article. This process excluded 71 more articles and we left with only 40 studies (Figure 1).\n\n\nData extraction\nWe developed a search string based on the DOI (digital object identifier) and title (if DOI is not available) of included studies to extract bibliometric metadata from the Scopus database. We retrieved bibliometric information for 39 articles on 09 May 2021. However, we could not extract metadata for an article because it was not available in Scopus; therefore, we excluded it from the final systematic map and narrative synthesis (Figure 1). This bibliometric data had several missing values (marked as NA); these values were manually added from the full text, if available.\nConsidering the questions posed, we looked for the following information (if available) for each article:\n\ngeographic location (latitude and longitude) to estimate the geographical distribution of studies. If it is not available in the study, we estimate the approximate location using Google Maps and Google Earth. We also recorded the Indian state in which the study was conducted.\nyear of the study to evaluate the temporal distribution of studies. We further estimated the decadal frequency of publications (1980–1989, 1990–1999, 2000–2009, 2010–2019, 2020–2021).\nthe domain of plant ecology for each study. Adopting a single unique classification system for ecological studies is difficult as study areas often overlap. However, we adhered to a previously proposed comprehensive classification system for the present study (Table 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Classification scheme for included studies\n\n\nDomain\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nOrganismal ecology\nPopulation genetics, natural selection, behaviour\n\n\nPhysiological ecology\nAdaptations to abiotic factors like temperature, light\n\n\nPopulation ecology\nPopulation growth, demography, age structure\n\n\nSpecies interactions\nCompetition, facilitation, parasitism, symbiosis\n\n\nCommunity ecology\nSpecies diversity, succession, biogeography\n\n\nEcosystem ecology\nFood web, biomass production, nutrient cycling, soil\n\n\nPalaeoecology\nFossil records, palaeo-vegetation\n\n\nLandscape ecology\nLand use and land cover, ecological modelling, spatial and global ecology\n\n\nApplied ecology\nConservation, management and restoration ecology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we manually assigned an ecological domain according the above classification system (Table 3).\n\n\nData analysis\nThe bibliometric data analysis was conducted using the package bibliometrix version 4.1.0(Aria and Cuccurullo 2017) in the R programming environment (R Core Team 2020). The attributes of manuscript (e.g. title, authors, citations, keywords) are connected with manuscript itself, such connections can be represented as rectangular matrices (Manuscripts \\(\\times\\) Attributes). For example, consider a rectangular binary matrix \\(A\\), where rows represent the manuscripts and columns represent the authors. The generic element \\(A_{ij}\\) is 1 if the manuscript \\(i\\) has author \\(j\\) and 0 otherwise. The \\(j^{th}\\) column sum \\(A_j\\) is the number of manuscripts authored by author \\(j\\). This rectangular matrix represents as a bipartite network of Manuscripts \\(\\times\\) Authors (Aria and Cuccurullo 2017; Glänzel and Schubert 2004). The authors’ collaboration network was calculated by multiplying the bipartite matrix by its transpose (the same matrix flipped along its diagonal).\n\\[AC = A^T \\times A\\]\nwhere, \\(A\\) is a bipartite network of Manuscripts × Authors and \\(A^T\\) is the transpose of \\(A\\). The diagonal element \\(AC_i\\) is the number of manuscripts authored or co-authored by the \\(i\\)th researcher.\nThe authors’ collaboration network helps identify the groups of researchers or teams, which is why scientific collaboration is frequently represented as the author collaboration network (Glänzel and Schubert 2004). In a collaboration network of authors, each node (or vertex) represents an author, and the edges between the nodes reflect the collaborative relationships among the authors. The weight of the edge reflects the number of manuscripts in which the connected authors have appeared (i.e., the number of manuscripts authored by both researchers).\nSimilarly, the keyword co-occurrence network was estimated from the bipartite network of Manuscripts × Keywords (Aria and Cuccurullo 2017). These keywords can be either provided by authors (‘Author Keywords’) or chosen by database third parties (‘Indexed Keywords’ in Scopus and ‘Keywords Plus’ in the case of Web of Science). We considered ‘Indexed Keywords’ for keyword co-occurrence because these are standardised by taking additional considerations such as synonyms, spelling variants, and plurals."

After de-duplication and article screening, these records were reduced to 40 studies (Figure 1). However, only 39 studies were included in the final synthesis as bibliographic metadata was not available for a study (Figure 1). Thus, this synthesis is based on 39 studies published in 26 sources (journals) from 1988 to 2021. The results of descriptive analysis of bibliometric indicators for selected studies are presented in Table 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: General description of extracted bibliometric indicators from Scopus\n\n\nDescription\nResults\n\n\n\n\nMain information about data\n\n\nTimespan\n1988:2021\n\n\nSources (Journals, Books, etc)\n26\n\n\nDocuments\n39\n\n\nAverage years from publication\n10.2\n\n\nAverage citations per documents\n19.67\n\n\nAverage citations per year per doc\n2.208\n\n\nReferences\n1842\n\n\nDocument types\n\n\narticle\n39\n\n\nDocument contents\n\n\nKeywords Plus (ID)\n368\n\n\nAuthor's Keywords (DE)\n160\n\n\nAuthors\n\n\nAuthors\n111\n\n\nAuthor Appearances\n155\n\n\nAuthors of single-authored documents\n0\n\n\nAuthors of multi-authored documents\n111\n\n\nAuthors collaboration\n\n\nSingle-authored documents\n0\n\n\nDocuments per Author\n0.351\n\n\nAuthors per Document\n2.85\n\n\nCo-Authors per Documents\n3.97\n\n\nCollaboration Index\n2.85\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe studies identified for the present review were published in 26 different journals. Further, only nine journals had represented more than one study identified in this article (Figure 2). These nine journals (about 34.6%) represented about 56.4% of the total studies (n = 22) included. The maximum number of studies (n = 4) were published in ‘International Journal of Remote Sensing’ (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Publication sources (journals) representing at least two studies identified in the present article. The number of publications in a particular journal is represented in parenthesis\n\n\n\n\nCitations of an article usually related with its impact and influence on a specific research field. Highly cited articles are considered to have substantially contributed to the advancement of the field. The articles identified in this review exhibited about 20 citations per article at the average rate of about two citations per article per year (Table 4). The present analysis found that the article by Yang et al. (2013) had the highest citation (n = 236) in which they used MaxEnt modelling to predict the distribution of Justicia adhatoda (Figure 3).

The connections among keywords were analysed using a keyword co-occurrence network of ‘indexed keyword’ which revealed three distinct patterns about the research field (Figure 4). The keyword ‘India’ and ‘himalayas’ were most dominant as suggested by largest nodes (Figure 4).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Co-occurrence network of indexed keywords (n = 25) from Scopus.

An analysis of the authors’ collaboration network suggested that authors form five distinct research groups working in different domains of plant ecology (Figure 5). The largest node for author ‘padalia h’ suggests that this researcher is highly productive and has published highest number of documents. Further, high weight of edges among the authors ‘padalia h’, ‘nandy s’, ‘chauhan p’ and ‘srinet r’ manifests that these authors frequently appear together i.e., they work as a team (Figure 5).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Collaboration network of authors (n = 25) from the selected studies.

The spatial distribution of studies suggest a high density around Uttarakhand state followed by Haryana (Figure 6). Our selected studies represented three states (Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, and Uttarakhand) and two union territories (Jammu and Kashmir and Chandigarh) of India (excluding studies conducted in multiple regions or whole region) and only five studies covered the whole region. Among the geographical regions, about 59% of total studies were featured from the Uttarakhand (n = 23) only (Figure 6). On the other hand, not a single study was identified from the Siwalik region of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Geographic distribution of the study sites (reported or estimated from publications) across the study region (JK = Jammu and Kashmir, HP = Himachal Pradesh, CH = Chandigarh, HR = Haryana, UK = Uttarakhand).

During 2010s annual production of scientific publications observed a steep rise and the year 2020 recorded highest number of publications (n = 6) within a single year (Figure 7). Further, the decadal frequency of publications was six during 1990s, which dipped to only two publication per decade during 2000s. However, it so steeply increased during 2010s that it became double of all studies published from 1980s to 2000s (Figure 7).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Annual frequency of scientific publications included in this synthesis.

Inset shows the decadal frequency of publications\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDomains of ecology\nWe found three distinct study types, six distinct study region and seven distinct domains of plant ecology (Figure 8). Among the selected 39 studies, experimental studies were under-represented, accounting for just about 5% of total studies. On the other hand, observational and modelling studies were heavily dominated constituting about 95% of all the studies (Figure 8).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Breakdown of selected studies by study type (EX, experimental; MO, modelling; OB, observational); region (CH, Chandigarh; HR, Haryana; HP, Himachal Pradesh; JK, Jammu and Kashmir; UK, Uttarakhand; WR, whole region) and domains of ecology (AE, applied ecology; CE, community ecology; EE, ecosystem ecology; LE, landscape ecology; PL, palaeoecology; PE, physiological ecology; SI, species interactions). The number of publications within each category is indicated in parenthesis\n\n\n\n\nWe identified seven distinct (not mutually exclusive) domains under plant ecology (Figure 8). Among these assigned domains, about 38.5% studies belonged to landscape ecology and 30.77% studies belonged to ecosystem ecology; thus, together constituting about 70% of total studies (Figure 8)."

    "title": "Plant ecology in Indian Siwalik range: a systematic map and its bibliometric analysis",
    "section": "Discussion",
    "text": "Discussion\nOur systematic map and bibliometric review, which is the first of its kind to our knowledge, identified several patterns and gaps in the literature. The methodological framework increases its reproducibility, which is a significant positive for this article. Our results showed that the plant ecology of the region is relatively unexplored and still in its infancy, as suggested by fewer peer-reviewed studies about the subject. However, the rapid growth of publications during the past decade indicates that ecological studies in the Indian Siwalik region are gaining importance among the various stakeholders. Our systematic map revealed that ‘landscape ecology’ and ‘ecosystem ecology’ have been primarily focused, whereas ‘applied ecology’, ‘organismal ecology’ and ‘population ecology’ were neglected in the Indian Siwaliks. The growing number of studies under ‘landscape ecology’ can be attributed to advancements in computation and availability of remote sensing data, allowing forest characterisation, species distribution modelling, land use, land cover analysis, ecological modelling, and prediction over a large area.\nThe geographical distribution of studies revealed a more significant bias towards the Siwaliks of Uttarakhand. This extreme bias can be attributed to research institutes in the region dedicated to ecology and environment (Forest Research Institute, Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, and Wildlife Institute of India). It seems that the number of studies is loosely associated with the number of institutes that are closer to the Siwalik region.\n\nState of plant ecology in Indian Siwaliks\nUnder ‘physiological ecology’, we considered studies involving the effects of the environment on the physiology of plants. In this regard, Sharma et al. (2018) studied the effects of elevated CO2 concentrations on the physiology of Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal (R. Sharma et al. 2018). This study showed that elevated CO2 increases photosynthetic rates and biomass production (R. Sharma et al. 2018). Another study observed the phenology of plants belonging to the family Anacardiaceae and found that environmental factors regulate various phases (D. Singh, Negi, and Purohit 2020). Although species interactions have not been exclusively studied, an experimental study showed the higher competitive ability of exotic Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit against the native Acacia nilotica (L.) Willd. ex Delile plant species (Bhatnagar, Bhandari, and Kapoor 1993).\nSeveral researchers analysed the forest structure and vegetation dynamics in the Indian Siwaliks (Rout and Gupta 1989; A. Singh, Reddy, and Singh 1995; Rawat and Bhainsora 1999; Mandal and Joshi 2015; Bhat et al. 2017). This region’s vegetation is considered subtropical deciduous forests, and the dominant plant species include Pinus roxburghii Sarg., Shorea robusta C.F.Gaertn., Anogeissus latifolia (Roxb. ex DC.) Wall. ex Guill. & Perr., Lannea coromandelica (Houtt.) Merr., and Flacourtia indica (Burm.f.) Merr. (Rout and Gupta 1989; A. Singh, Reddy, and Singh 1995; Rawat and Bhainsora 1999). The vegetation associations or community composition are suggested to be affected by soil properties (Mandal and Joshi 2015) and seasonal variations (Bhat et al. 2017). The vegetation association patterns were analysed using dominance-diversity curves (Rout and Gupta 1989), detrended correspondence analysis (A. Singh, Reddy, and Singh 1995), and TWINSPAN (Rawat and Bhainsora 1999; Bhat et al. 2017).\nStudies concerning ecosystem ecology of the Indian Siwaliks have primarily focused on soil characterisation (Bargali, Singh, and Joshi 1993; Gupta et al. 2010; T. Sharma and Singh 2017; Hussain et al. 2019; Dinesh et al. 2020), biomass production (Rana, Singh, and Singh 1988; Lodhiyal and Lodhiyal 2003; Rahul Singh et al. 2019), carbon stock and nutrient cycling (Rout and Gupta 1990b, 1990a; C. M. Sharma et al. 2010; Taibanganba Watham et al. 2020). Soil physicochemical properties, primarily organic carbon and nutrients, decreased with time as natural forests were replaced by Eucalypt plantations (Bargali, Singh, and Joshi 1993). Further, soil properties are shown to vary along with the soil depth in different geomorphic units (Dinesh et al. 2020). The soil depth and the soil properties varied among other land uses (Gupta et al. 2010; Hussain et al. 2019); forest lands have better physicochemical parameters than barren lands (Gupta et al. 2010). Furthermore, the soils of the Siwaliks are highly susceptible to erosion, and the highly susceptible regions are often identified using geo-statistical techniques (T. Sharma and Singh 2017).\nChir pine (Pinus roxburghii Sarg.) is one of the dominant tree species of the Siwalik region, and it forms pine forests or mixed pine forests. A study found that the estimated total biomass was 199 t ha−1, whereas the net primary production was 12.4 t ha−1 yr−1 for a mixed pine forest (Rana, Singh, and Singh 1988). Another study showed that biomass and net primary production increase with age in a planted forest of Dalbergia sissoo Roxb. (Lodhiyal and Lodhiyal 2003). Further, biomass production was observed to vary among land-use types, decreasing with elevation (Rahul Singh et al. 2019). The herbaceous biomass varied due to season and was highest during the rainy season under pine forests (Rout and Gupta 1990a). Since Siwalik forests are subtropical deciduous types, the litterfall, litter mass, and litter nutrients also varied seasonally (Rout and Gupta 1990a). The litterfall showed two distinct peaks during the winter and summer months. Nutrient turnover also displayed differences due to season and forest types (Rout and Gupta 1990b). The nutrient turnover rate was higher in mixed forests than the pine or scrub forests (Rout and Gupta 1990b). Recently, a study showed that the Siwalik forests act as a concrete sink to the atmospheric CO2, and this carbon exchange is affected by the monsoon (Taibanganba Watham et al. 2020).\nRemote sensing satellite data and modelling techniques are valuable tools to infer ecosystem structure and processes’ spatial and temporal patterns. Several researchers used these tools for vegetation characterisation (Kimothi and Dasari 2010; M. Munsi et al. 2010; Padalia, Kudrat, and Sharma 2013; Srinet, Nandy, Padalia, et al. 2020; A. P. Mishra et al. 2021), forest dynamics (Joshi, Yadav, and Sinha 2011; Joshi et al. 2012; Madhushree Munsi, Areendran, and Joshi 2012; Areendran et al. 2017; M. Kumar et al. 2021), species distribution modelling (Yang et al. 2013; Lamsal et al. 2018), spatial heterogeneity (M. Kumar et al. 2019), atmospheric CO2 dynamics (T. Watham et al. 2021), gross primary productivity modelling (N. B. Mishra and Chaudhuri 2015; Srinet, Nandy, Watham, et al. 2020), and foliar nutrients modelling (Vasudeva et al. 2021) in the Indian Siwalik region.\nIndian satellite IRS-LISS (Kimothi and Dasari 2010; M. Munsi et al. 2010) and Cartosat-1 (Kimothi and Dasari 2010) as well as global satellite Landsat (M. Munsi et al. 2010), EO-1 (Padalia, Kudrat, and Sharma 2013), MODIS (Srinet, Nandy, Padalia, et al. 2020) and Sentinel-2 (A. P. Mishra et al. 2021) data were used to map and characterise the vegetation. Not only the satellite data but also different classification algorithms like supervised maximum likelihood classifier (Kimothi and Dasari 2010; M. Munsi et al. 2010), spectral unmixing technique (Padalia, Kudrat, and Sharma 2013), and random forest classifier (Srinet, Nandy, Padalia, et al. 2020; A. P. Mishra et al. 2021) were used. These studies mapped the extent of invasive plants (Kimothi and Dasari 2010; Padalia, Kudrat, and Sharma 2013) and characterised forests at the landscape (M. Munsi et al. 2010), functional types (Srinet, Nandy, Padalia, et al. 2020), and community levels (A. P. Mishra et al. 2021).\nLand use and land cover (LULC) analysis allow observing landscapes’ spatial and temporal changes (Joshi, Yadav, and Sinha 2011; Madhushree Munsi, Areendran, and Joshi 2012; Areendran et al. 2017). Using LULC and ‘land change modeller’, it has been shown that the forested landscapes tended to decrease whereas non-forested areas increased over time (Joshi, Yadav, and Sinha 2011; Madhushree Munsi, Areendran, and Joshi 2012; Areendran et al. 2017). These dynamics of forested landscapes have emerged as a challenge for the management of protected areas (Joshi, Yadav, and Sinha 2011; Areendran et al. 2017). Although human activities are significant drivers of landscape change, climate change is also projected to shift all the forest types except subtropical conifer forests (Joshi et al. 2012). Further, multi-criteria forest vulnerability assessment suggested that forests at low elevations are more vulnerable than the high elevation forests types (M. Kumar et al. 2021).\nEcological modelling is not only limited to species distribution modelling (Yang et al. 2013; Lamsal et al. 2018), but it has expanded to model various ecosystem processes like productivity and foliar nutrients. MaxEnt modelling was used to predict the distribution of Justicia adhatoda L. (Yang et al. 2013) and some invasive plants (Lamsal et al. 2018). Further, it has been suggested that the spread of invasive plants is affected by spatial heterogeneity (M. Kumar et al. 2019).\nThe dynamics of atmospheric CO2 suggested that its concentrations peak from midnight to morning in July over the forests of Indian Siwaliks, and the seasonal variations of CO2 is influenced by rainfall patterns (T. Watham et al. 2021). Similarly, the spatio-temporal patterns of productivity also showed seasonal variations (N. B. Mishra and Chaudhuri 2015; Srinet, Nandy, Watham, et al. 2020). Further, temporal trends in productivity suggested that the forests of the Siwalik region have experienced more browning than the greening (N. B. Mishra and Chaudhuri 2015). The temperature-greenness model with MODIS satellite data was used to estimate the Siwalik forests’ gross primary productivity (GPP). GPP ranged from 0.20 to 18.57 g C m−2 day−1, and it was higher for moist deciduous forests than the dry deciduous forests (Srinet, Nandy, Watham, et al. 2020). Further, the machine learning algorithms were applied to Sentinel-2 satellite data to map spatial variability of foliar carbon and nitrogen (Vasudeva et al. 2021).\nThe evolutionary history of vegetation is often discerned with fossil evidence and palaeoecological studies. A study based on the carbon isotope ratio suggested that C3 type vegetation dominated before 9 Ma (Mega-annum). However, C3–C4 mixed vegetation existed during 9 to 8 Ma, which became C4 dominated after 7.3 Ma (Sanyal et al. 2005). Carbon and oxygen isotopic studies in the Siwaliks indicated that the evolution of C4 was not synchronous (Sanyal et al. 2005; Ghosh et al. 2018). This asynchronous expansion of C4 plants suggests that their abundance is affected by regional factors like substrate quality (Ghosh et al. 2018).\n\n\nKnowledge gaps and future research\nOur systematic map identified several gaps in the current knowledge about plant ecology in the Indian Siwaliks. The scarce peer-reviewed literature indicates that little is known about the plant ecology of the region. Although the field is proliferating, many aspects remained unexplored. Experimental studies, specifically studies using manipulative experiments, were under-represented, indicating a need to complement the observational and modelling studies. We were unable to identify a single peer-reviewed study regarding ‘organismal ecology’, which considers population genetics, natural selection, behavioural patterns of plants exclusively in the Indian Siwaliks. Similarly, applied ecological studies, including management of invasive species and restoration ecology, have not been prioritised yet. Further, there is a need to study the population growth, demography, and age structure of dominant plant species in the region; however, the age structure of some plants has been previously characterised (Rout and Gupta 1989).\nOur review indicates that very little work has been undertaken about plant ecology in the Indian Siwaliks. The Indian Siwaliks are facing significant stressors, including climate change, invasive species, industrialisation, urbanisation, landslides, and soil erosion, to our knowledge and experience. These stressors threaten the ecosystem structure and functions, promoting biodiversity development and ecosystem services that eventually affect the well-being of society. Therefore, we urge the scientific community to prioritise these ecological challenges and guide informed decisions for the sustainable management of natural resources in the Indian Siwaliks. Next, we suggest non-exhaustive broad research themes for the Indian Siwaliks for upcoming decades. We suggest developing a database by cataloguing a whole region’s exclusive flora with geographic information on species occurrences. This catalogue will help to map and project the species distributions. Furthermore, it will form the basis to develop and test biogeographical hypotheses. After identifying dominant plant species, we suggest assessing the physiological responses of these plants to various abiotic (light, temperature, water, and nutrients) and biotic stressors (pathogens, competition, herbivory, and allelopathy). Next, we suggest characterising ecosystem structure and functions in response to local stressors like climate change, invasibility, and disturbance. Finally, we need to prepare the plans and policies to restore the already degraded ecosystems in the region.\nAlthough the present study attempted to provide a comprehensive state of plant ecology in Indian Siwaliks, we acknowledge that it suffers from several limitations.\n\nFirstly, the initial conceptualisation of plant ecology might be cloudy; because there are no clear-cut boundaries between sub-disciplines as they are often interconnected and overlapping. This overlapping is also true for our proposed classification system, and some studies can be put into multiple categories leading to different results.\nFurther, we considered only peer-reviewed literature indexed in Scopus and Web of Science Core Collections. It does not mean anyway that studies published in local sources (journals, books, and other sources) are of less importance or compromised quality.\nIn addition to this, we excluded studies whose full text was non-retrievable or metadata was not available, and the inclusion of such studies have produced different results.\nAs with any systematic exercise, any alteration or modifications in the protocol (search string and eligibility criteria) will lead to different results. Further, pre-registration of protocol and other stakeholders’ engagement might have helped produce a less biased systematic map.\n\nThus, the present article acknowledges the present limitations and recommends incorporating these parameters in scoping reviews based on a systematic methodological framework."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe present systematic map assessed the state of plant ecology in Indian Siwaliks and provided a methodological framework for transparent and reproducible reviews. The proportion of studies focusing on plant ecology is disproportionately more petite than the demand for ecological understanding about the region. Despite the proliferation of ecological studies during the past decade, increased understanding is required about the ecological structure and functions of the Siwalik landscape. The evidence base is often very scarce and scattered that too suffers from geographic and discipline-specific bias. Therefore, we urge researchers to carry out scientific investigations focusing on the ecological problems of the region. These investigations will help make evidence-based decisions and policies for future research lines to sustain this fragile ecosystem."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nCoal extraction by opencast mining involves the dumping of overburden or mine spoil as large heaps. These large heaps of overburdened materials can act as a serious threat to ecological integrity and, therefore, overall societal well-being. Plantations are often employed to establish revegetation and management of mine spoil, thus mitigating the effects of mining on the environment. However, the performance of plant species can be highly variable due to environmental and species-specific effects. Therefore, the present paper’s primary objective is to compare exotic (Acacia auriculiformis, Cassia siamea, Casuarina equisetifolia and Grevillea pteridifolia) and native (Albizia lebbeck, Albizia procera, Dendrocalamus strictus and Tectona grandis) species’ performance on the coal mine spoils. Previous studies on the Singrauli coalfields allowed us to compare the growth performance, standing biomass, and net primary production (NPP) of four exotic and four native species plantations. Our results showed that native species have significantly higher survival, stem diameter, biomass, and NPP than exotic woody plantations. Thus, exotic species might not be useful in mine spoil rehabilitation than the native species. Overall, this study suggests that native species are useful for mine spoil rehabilitation despite the faster growth of exotic species.\nKeywords: Ecological restoration; Soil redevelopment; Exotic species; Native species; Coal mine spoil"

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nIndia is one of the significant coal producers worldwide; however, the demand for coal for electricity generation and industrial production is so high that it needs to import substantial coal quantities (IEA 2019). Most of the coal in India is extracted by surface mining, which involves removing the earth’s surface in the form of sheets resulting in a large amount of waste material, usually referred to as overburden or mine spoil (A. N. Singh and Singh 2006). This overburden is piled up to form new landforms looking like large stacks of mine spoil until refilling. These piles of mine spoils are characterised by a high concentration of metals and toxic chemical compounds (Novianti et al. 2018), which cascades into the ecosystem and reaches humans through various sources like contaminated food and water. Further, removal of topsoil and alteration in soil profile causes unavoidable loss to biodiversity, which disrupts the ecosystem structure and functions (Adibee, Osanloo, and Rahmanpour 2013; Feng et al. 2019).\nGrowing concerns about the environmental impacts of coal mining, together with the slow natural recovery of mine spoils, urge technical solutions to restore these degraded ecosystems into their original states (Macdonald et al. 2015). A successful restoration programme accelerates the natural recovery processes to check soil erosion, restore soil fertility, and enhance biological diversity (A. N. Singh, Raghubanshi, and Singh 2002). Therefore, the first step in any restoration programme, of course, is to protect the disturbed habitat and communities from being further wasted. Then follow attempts to accelerate the revegetation process for increasing biodiversity and stabilising nutrient cycling (A. N. Singh and Singh 2006; A. N. Singh, Zeng, and Chen 2006).\nPlantations have been contemporarily used to restore degraded lands worldwide effectively (Badı́a et al. 2007; Bohre and Chaubey 2016; Erskine, Lamb, and Borschmann 2005; Jeżowski et al. 2017; A. Singh 2001; A. N. Singh and Singh 1999; A. N. Singh, Raghubanshi, and Singh 2004b). However, the suitability of species and their performance on coal mine spoil have remained a challenging task as the characteristics of coal mine spoils are highly heterogeneous and lack soil organic matter (SOM), so that it is regarded as a recalcitrant medium for plant growth (Adibee, Osanloo, and Rahmanpour 2013; Feng et al. 2019; K. Singh, Singh, and Tewari 2021).\nSome of the earlier studies have evaluated several plant species’ growth and biomass production on coal mine spoil (Badı́a et al. 2007; Bohre and Chaubey 2016; Erskine, Lamb, and Borschmann 2005; Jeżowski et al. 2017; A. Singh 2001; A. N. Singh and Singh 1999; A. N. Singh, Raghubanshi, and Singh 2004b). Although exotic woody species are often suggested to restore coal mine spoil due to their fast growth and high economic or livelihood benefits, it often results in low biodiversity development (DAntonio and Meyerson 2002; Dutta and Agrawal 2003; Lamb, Erskine, and Parrotta 2005). Many previous studies have shown that exotic species can positively or negatively impact soil fertility and native flora while restoring degraded lands (Berger 1993; DAntonio and Meyerson 2002; Yan et al. 2020). Although exotic species may have higher survival (Citadini-Zanette et al. 2017) and improve soil properties (Yan et al. 2020), they often result in low carbon development compared to native species (Citadini-Zanette et al. 2017).\nNet primary production is considered a critical functional parameter that helps evaluate species’ quality. Biomass is a crucial parameter of structural attributes. They directly contribute to organic matter, energy transformation, and nutrient cycling between vegetation and soil. Exotic species show successful establishment, and their fast growth often outcompetes the native species during the restoration (Huxtable, Koen, and Waterhouse 2005). Another study showed slight differences in biomass production among the exotic and native plants established on degraded lands (Islam et al. 1999). The biomass allocation to different plant parts can be controlled by environmental and biological (species-specific) factors (Boonman et al. 2020; Freschet, Swart, and Cornelissen 2015; Poorter and Sack 2012). However, the biomass allocation to different plant parts can vary between exotic and native species because species may have adapted to their native habitats and exhibit differential allocation strategies. Thus, there is a need for an increased understanding of the biology and impacts of exotic and native species on degraded lands. Therefore, comparing survival, growth and biomass production among exotic and native species becomes essential to assess the suitability of plant species for the reclamation process.\nThe present study compares the survival, growth performance, biomass accumulation, net primary productivity of 5-year-old native and exotic woody plantations established on coal mine spoils. We expect exotic species to have higher survival, growth, and biomass production on coal mine spoils because they usually exhibit higher competitive abilities. Therefore, they can sustain themselves on nutrient-poor and degraded lands. Specifically, we address the following four questions from our study:\n\nCan native species have higher survival and growth performance on coal mine spoils?\nWhat are the biomass and net primary production level among native and exotic plantations at earlier stages?\nWhether biomass production and net primary production (NPP) are species-specific?"

    "text": "Material and methods\n\nStudy site and climate\nThe plantations under present study were located in the west section of Jayant block of Singrauli Coalfields in Singrauli district of Madhya Pradesh, India, which lies between latitudes 24° 6′ 45″ – 24° 11′ 15″ N and longitude 82° 36′ 40″ – 82° 41′ 15″ E. The study area is situated on a plateau above the plain (around 500 m above mean sea level) on its southwest side. In contrast, the plateau’s foot’s average elevation is approximately 300 m above mean sea level. The climate of the area is tropical monsoon, and the year is divisible into a mild winter (November–February), a hot summer (March–June), and a warm rainy season (July–October). The mean monthly minimum temperature within the annual cycle ranges from 6 to 28 °C and the mean monthly maximum from 20 to 40 °C. The rainfall annually averages 1069 mm, of which about 90% occurs from late June to early September. The rainfall is characterised by a high degree of inter-annual variation, as during the study period 1990–1996, it ranges from 700 to 1450 mm yr−1 (A. N. Singh, Raghubanshi, and Singh 2004b, 2004a).\n\n\nPlantations and experimental design\nPlantations of native species were raised in July–August of 1990–91 by planting nursery-raised seedlings in previously dug pits of 40 cm × 40 cm × 40 cm size at a spacing of 2 m × 2 m. The plantations of Albizia lebbeck (L.) Benth., Albizia procera (Roxb.) Benth. and Tectona grandis L.f. were raised in 1990, whereas Dendrocalamus strictus Nees plantation was raised in 1991 by planting 7 to 8 months old nursery raised seedlings. The total planted area for A. lebbeck and A. procera was 1.5 ha, whereas the same for T. grandis and D. strictus was about 0.5 ha each. For sampling, three permanent plots were established for each species. The sample plots’ size was 25 m × 25 m for A. lebbeck and A. procera whereas 15 m × 15 m plot size for T. grandis and D. strictus.\nInitially a total of 2500 seedlings per hectare were planted for each species. After five years, survival is estimated as the number of individuals (clumps in D. strictus) in each plot, which was inventoried in February–March during 1995–1996.\n\n\nBiomass and net primary production\nAllometric equations relating tree dimensions to the plant parts’ biomass were developed to measure tree biomass. Twelve individuals of each species, representing a gradient of diameter, were felled from an area adjoining the permanent plots, and their diameter (D) and height (H) were measured. The felled individuals were separated into stem and foliage. The root systems of the felled plants were excavated to a depth of 1 m. Each component’s fresh weight (stem, foliage, and coarse roots with a diameter greater than 5 mm) was recorded in the field. Sub-samples were brought to the laboratory to determine dry weights. The data were subjected to regression analysis to relate the dry weight of stem, foliage, rhizome, and root with D or D2H or their natural log values. The highest R2 (correlation coefficient) equations were selected, which were also used in earlier studies (Dutta and Agrawal 2003; A. N. Singh, Raghubanshi, and Singh 2004b; A. N. Singh and Singh 1999). The standing biomass of different components (stem, foliage, and root) was calculated using the biomass estimation equations. These values were then multiplied by the density of tree species. Per hectare biomass estimations were obtained separately for each plot and averaged across the plots to get the mean estimates at different ages.\nFine root (less than 5 mm in diameter) biomass was quantified by digging out 20 cm × 20 cm × 20 cm monoliths at 20 cm intervals from the plant base to 1-m distance. Monoliths were washed with a fine jet of water, and fine roots were collected, dried, and weighed. Tree roots were separated from roots of herbaceous plants based on colour and appearance.\nThe net primary production was estimated using diameter increments and biomass data described by earlier studies on the study site (Dutta and Agrawal 2003; A. N. Singh, Raghubanshi, and Singh 2004a; L. Singh and Singh 1991).\n\n\nData for exotic species\nPrevious studies have investigated the restoration potential of some exotic species on the same study site (Dutta and Agrawal 2003, 2001; J. S. Singh, Singh, and Jha 1995). These studies provided an opportunity to compare exotic and native species’ restoration potential because they followed a similar experimental design. These studies considered four exotic species (Casuarina equisetifolia L., Cassia siamea Lam., Grevillea pteridifolia Knight, and Acacia auriculiformis A. Cunn. ex Benth.). The total planted area for C. equisetifolia and G. pteridifolia was 1.5 ha each, whereas the same for A. auriculiformis and C. siamea was about 0.5 ha each. For sampling, three permanent plots were established for each species. The sample plots’ size was 25 m × 25 m for C. equisetifolia and G. pteridifolia and; 10 m × 10 m for A. auriculiformis and C. siamea (Dutta and Agrawal 2003, 2001; J. S. Singh, Singh, and Jha 1995).\n\n\nStatistical analyses\nSPSS-PC statistical software was used for all statistical analyses, except wherever specifically mentioned. The data were subjected to the General Linear Model (GLM) for analysis of variance (ANOVA) to observe the species’ effect. Mean values were tested for difference among plantation species with Tukey’s honestly significant difference (HSD) mean separation test (SPSS, 2003, version 10.0). Regression equations were developed through the same statistical package. To observe the effect of origin (exotic vs. native), student’s t-test was conducted using the package rstatix (Kassambara 2021) in the R language and environment for statistical computation (R Core Team 2020)."

Therefore, values in native plantations significantly varied from 7.68 to 74.68 t ha-1, minimum for T. grandis and maximum for D. strictus plantation and 8.49-31.03 t ha-1 exotic plantations, being maximum in A. auriculiformis and minimum in C. siamea (Table 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4:  Biomass production (t / ha) under 5-yr old planted exotic and native\nwoody species on coal mine spoil \n  \n  \n    \n      Parameters\n      \n        Exotic\n      \n      \n        Native\n      \n    \n    \n      AA\n      CE\n      CS\n      GP\n      AL\n      AP\n      TG\n      DS1\n    \n  \n  \n    Foliage\n\n6.68bc\n\n2.74d\n\n0.72e\n\n5.06c\n\n6.59bc\n\n7.26b\n\n2.39de\n\n10.68a\n\n    Stem\n\n16.77c\n\n15.69c\n\n4.91e\n\n11.46d\n\n32.32b\n\n14.21cd\n\n2.98e\n\n38.5a\n\n    Coarse root\n\n4.53d\n\n2.98e\n\n2.56e\n\n5.84c\n\n12.05a\n\n10.65b\n\n1.94e\n\n5.27cd\n\n    Fine root\n\n3.05a\n\n0.40c\n\n0.30c\n\n0.57c\n\n0.85bc\n\n0.74bc\n\n0.37c\n\n1.40b\n\n    Total\n\n31.03c\n\n21.81d\n\n8.49e\n\n22.90d\n\n51.81b\n\n32.86c\n\n7.68e\n\n74.68a\n\n  \n  \n    \n      Data for exotic species obtained from Dutta and Agrawal (2003) and Singh et al.

However, the belowground biomass was higher for leguminous species than the non-leguminous species (Figure 3 d). Moreover, relative contributions of short-lived components (foliage and fine root &lt; 5 mm) were small as compared to long-lived tree component (stem) to the tree layer biomass for both types of plantations calculated at 5-yr age (Figure 3 e), and a similar pattern was observed for the leguminous and non-leguminous species (Figure 3 f).

    "section": "Discussion",
    "text": "Discussion\n\nNative species plantations had a higher survival\nThe present study indicated that native species better survive on degraded lands than exotic species, supported by earlier studies (Islam et al. 1999). Although some previous studies have investigated survivability of native species on coal mine spoil (Mosseler, Major, and Labrecque 2014; A. N. Singh, Raghubanshi, and Singh 2004b, 2004a), very few studies compared survivability with exotic species (Huxtable, Koen, and Waterhouse 2005; Islam et al. 1999). Another study conducted on saline soils of northern Australia also suggested the high survival of native species (D. Sun and Dickinson 1995). Evidently, in this study, more remarkable survival was observed in all native species indicating better adaptability of species for mine spoil restoration. Thus, the higher survival of native species may be due to their pre-adaptation to the environmental conditions. However, survival may not be directly linked to species’ origin; rather, it can be a legacy of function and life-history traits. Therefore, survival cannot be considered as the only indicator of ecological restoration.\n\n\nGrowth performance\nThe height and diameter of woody plant species are critical structural parameters involved in measuring growth performance, which is affected by environmental conditions (Lestari et al. 2019; Sumida, Miyaura, and Torii 2013). Our results suggested that exotic plants tend to invest more photosynthates in height growth, whereas native plants invested more photosynthates in stem growth. A higher diameter in native species indicates the possibility of their adaptation to windbreak and endorses a longer establishment. Further, these observations indicate that exotic plants might be suffering from a limitation of light. In contrast, native plants may be pre-adapted to environmental conditions and therefore invested more photosynthates in diameter for an efficient supply of resources to the shoot (Boonman et al. 2020). However, this finding contrasts the reports of an earlier study in similar environmental conditions (Islam et al. 1999).\nHeight growth is usually associated with the production of newer leaves and more significant resource acquisition. In contrast, the increase in stem diameter ensures tissues’ development supports the leaves (Sumida, Miyaura, and Torii 2013). Thus, the increase in height should be accompanied by an increase in the stem’s diameter, as suggested by biomechanical models (Henry and Aarssen 1999; J. Sun et al. 2019). Our results also seemed to support this hypothesis at least in exotic species but contrasted by the non-leguminous species, suggesting a trade-off between height and diameter in non-leguminous plants, possibly due to limited resources.\nIn contrast to height growth, diameter growth depends primarily on current photosynthesis, although some reserve carbohydrates may be used for diameter growth very early in the season (Kozlowski 1962). Thus, the greater height in case of exotic species can be attributed to their higher photosynthetic rate 12.1 (A. auriculiformis) to 30.14 µmol CO2 m-2 s-1 (C. equisetifolia) as compared to native plantations in the present research site might be a promoting point to faster growth behaviour of exotic species (V. Singh and Toky 1995). The smaller height to diameter ratio of exotic species indicates their higher competitive ability and rapid growth on degraded sites. This view is supported by a study conducted on the degraded tropical pasture of southern Costa Rica, where it was shown that exotic species outperformed the native plantations (Carpenter, Nichols, and Sandi 2004). Nevertheless, native species can also display growth rates similar to exotic species depending on the site environments (Bare and Ashton 2016).\n\n\nBiomass and net primary production\nThe present study indicated that native species produced higher biomass as compared to exotic species. This suggests a better adaptation and higher resource use efficiency of native species than the exotic species on the coal mine spoil. In contrast to our finding, a previous study reported little differences in biomass production among the exotic and native species (Islam et al. 1999).\nFurther, biomass partitioning into different plant parts revealed that native species produced significantly higher biomass for foliage, stem, and coarse roots (diameter greater than 5 mm) compared to exotic species. In contrast, fine root biomass was higher in the case of exotic species, though not significant. Higher biomass production of fine roots in exotic species suggests that these plants responded to the stressed environment of coal mine spoils to get available nutrient and water sources to maintain their growth performance, especially height instead of diameter (Boonman et al. 2020).\nSince the present study focused on woody tree species, the higher contribution of aboveground biomass to the total biomass is expectable and supported by many previous studies; exotic species invested more in belowground components. In contrast, native species invested more in aboveground components while responding to the same coal mine spoils. It is believed that plants tend to invest more in belowground components during the disturbance or stressful conditions such as the nutrient-poor coal mine spoils (Poorter and Sack 2012; Priest et al. 2015). Further, both species invested more in long-lived components than in short-lived components; however, exotic species invested more in short-lived components, especially the fine roots. The long-lived component (stem) contribution was much higher than to NPP in all four native species but the opposite in the exotic plantations. Thus, the short-lived components might be associated with ecosystem functions whereas long-lived components account for structural attributes in the native plantations.\nMoreover, foliage accounted for a lower proportion of ecosystem function in all plantations of exotic species. In contrast, native species showed considerably very high that more foliage biomass production in such a stressed environment (degraded mine spoil) may provide more soil organic matter to regulate the cycling of nutrients. The native and exotic species have different allocational strategies.\nAccording to the functional equilibrium hypothesis, this suggests that exotic species may experience belowground resource (water and nutrients) limitation, whereas native species experience an aboveground resource (sunlight and CO2) limitation (Boonman et al. 2020; Brouwer 1983). These changes may be attributed to morphological adaptations or phenotypic plasticity rather than biomass allocation (Freschet, Swart, and Cornelissen 2015; Poorter and Sack 2012). However, if none of the resources is limiting or equally limiting, plants tend to allocate the resources optimally. This is referred to as the ‘optimal partitioning hypothesis’ (Gedroc, McConnaughay, and Coleman 1996) or ‘balanced growth hypothesis’ (Shipley and Meziane 2002). Thus, if both types of species faced similar environmental conditions (probably that was the case in the present study), those species which produce greater belowground biomass during the initial stages may be better suited for reclamation of coal mine overburden. Following this, our results suggest that exotic and leguminous plants may be better suited for coal mine restoration, though these effects can be highly species-specific.\nThe net primary production or NPP is associated with photosynthesis and biomass production, as indicated by a strong positive relation between biomass and NPP. The present study suggested an overall NPP ranging from 3 to 32 t ha-1 yr-1, comparable to earlier studies (Dutta and Agrawal 2003; A. N. Singh and Singh 1999; V. Singh and Toky 1995). The early successional species are reported to exhibit net production of 8-21 t ha-1 yr-1 in natural dry tropical forests (Murphy and Lugo 1986), whereas the aboveground net production of plantations on coal mine spoil and natural forests in the tropical zone ranged between 1.5 and 32.62 t ha-1 yr-1 (Dutta and Agrawal 2003; P. K. Singh and Singh 1998; V. Singh and Toky 1995; L. Singh and Singh 1991). However, our comparison suggested that native species had significantly higher total and foliage NPP than the exotic species on coal mine spoils. This indicated that native species were much more efficient in resource utilisation, possibly due to their pre-adaptation to the tropical environments. Thus, achieving an early vegetation cover and high biomass production on mine spoil can be approached through proper selection and planting of pioneer native tree species. Such species can exist under harsh soil conditions and require less long-term maintenance (A. N. Singh, Raghubanshi, and Singh 2004b; A. N. Singh and Singh 2006)."

    "text": "Conclusions\nThe present study points out that native species performs well than the exotic species in the rehabilitation and restoration of coal mine spoils. This conclusion is supported by the higher biomass and NPP for native species compared to exotic species, though exotic species exhibited more remarkable height growth. However, consideration of species’ leguminous nature did not affect the biomass and NPP in the present study, though it may affect the redevelopment of soils in degraded habitats. Further, the effect of exotic species seemed to be highly variable and species-specific. Therefore, more comparative knowledge on the species-specific effects on ecosystem restoration, biodiversity reconstruction, and its possible effects on their services towards the ecosystem and local people is still required. Therefore, more future investigations on various ecological restoration scales are warranted with a more significant number of species while inferring effects of exotic and native species for comparative restoration potential."

    "text": "Abstract\nOverburden excavated during opencast mining has poorer soil properties due to non-salvage and inversion of soil profiles. One of the negative consequences of opencast coal mining is the production of large amounts of nutrient-poor, infertile, and degraded soils. The soil properties of such overburden restoration of such damaged lands are often improved achieved by planting suitable plant species; however, baseline data for selection and performance of plantation species is lacking the performance of species varies site-to-site. Therefore, this paper aims to test the established evaluated the effects of woody plantations on the physico-chemical and biological properties of coal mine spoil. We synthesized the available data from previous studies conducted on 5-year-plantations in Singrauli coalfields of India. These plantations have monoculture of total eight species, in which four were exotic (Acacia auriculiformis, Casuarina equisetifolia, Cassia siamea and Grevillea pteridifolia) and four were native species (Albizia lebbeck, Albizia procera, Dendrocalamus strictus and Tectona grandis). We compared the soil properties under exotic and native species plantations to evaluate the effect of species origin. Our results showed that the clay content (p &lt; 0.000), ammonium-nitrogen (p &lt; 0.000), inorganic total phosphate (p = 0.009), and microbial biomass nutrients (C, N, and P; p &lt; 0.000) were significantly higher under native plantations than the exotic plantations. Overall, our study suggested that exotic species plantations, either legume or non-leguminous, are not as useful as native species in mine spoil rehabilitation. Thus, native species plantations should be promoted while restoring a coal mine spoil in dry tropical environments.\nKeywords: ecological restoration, soil redevelopment, exotic species, native species, coal mine spoil, woody plantations"

    "text": "Introduction\nOpencast mining involves excavation and removal of overburden to extract the coal. This removed overburden is dumped aside as large heaps. have poor soil properties due to alterations in soil profile. Since native soils were not salvaged, the surface provides a harsh and heterogeneous media for plant growth. Coal extraction by surface mining (opencast) process drastically alters the mining area’s physical and biological nature (Feng et al. 2019). The leftover coal mine spoil or overburden represent damaged and disrupted ecosystems that are hard to restore into their original state (Berger 1993). The soils of these coal mine spoil heaps are characterized by high bulk density, pH, low nutrients (carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus) and high concentrations of toxic metals (Feng et al. 2019). Such soils have limited capability to support vegetation and natural recovery of vegetation is very slow in such ecosystems. The increased concerns about the negative impacts of mining and land degradation have stimulated scientific community to devise technologies to restore such damaged landscapes. The first step in any restoration program should focus on the protection of disturbed habitat and communities from being further wasted. Then attempt to accelerate the re-vegetation process to increase biodiversity and stabilize nutrient cycling (J. S. Singh, Singh, and Jha 1995; A. N. Singh and Singh 2006; A. N. Singh, Zeng, and Chen 2006). However, the success of a restoration program depends on the quality of planted species, parent material, and environmental conditions (A. N. Singh, Raghubanshi, and Singh 2002). Further, providing good surface material such as mulch or some other plant material is useful for enhancing re-vegetation of degraded sites. Therefore, there is a strong need to evaluate the restoration potentials of different plant species to support the restoration practitioners, engineers and scientific community.\nPlantations have been widely employed to restore the damaged and degraded lands. In this context, Fisher (1995) suggested five general hypotheses for the mechanisms that contribute to the amelioration of degraded lands by planting certain desirable species (Fisher 1995). The mechanisms involve: first, an increase in the soil organic matter contents resulting from carbon (C) fixation in photosynthesis and its transfer via leaf litter and root turnover to the soil. Second, some leguminous trees’ nitrogen (N) fixation increases soil N content under the tree canopy. Third, the tree’s rhizospheric effect on soils resulted in enhanced N mineralization and increased microbial biomass. Fourth, microclimate modification by tree canopies that moderate soil and air temperatures and soil moisture regimes. Fifth, nutrient pumping reflects the uptake of nutrients from greater depths by tree roots and accumulation in a smaller surface soil volume due to litterfall.\nSoil physicochemical properties are greatly influenced by the plant species growing above the soil due to variations in individual species traits (Waring et al. 2015). The choice of species for restoration of degraded lands remained debatable an area of interest among the scientific community and restoration practitioners. Since exotic and native species are adapted to different local environment, they have differential restoration potential due to variations in functional traits. Exotic plants are recommended for restoration due to their faster growth and biomass production. Further, high disturbance and heterogeneity favors their growth and establishment. However, many researchers pointed out the negative impacts of exotic species on the soil fertility and native flora; therefore suggested to avoid exotic species for restoration program (Cusack and Montagnini 2004; Diemont et al. 2006; Lugo, Wang, and Herbert Bormann 1990). In contrast to this, some researchers argued that exotic species may be especially recommended for primary rehabilitation on bare coal mine spoil due to their fast growth and establishment (DAntonio and Meyerson 2002; Parrotta 1999; Parrotta and Knowles 2001). Thus, evaluation of species’ effects on coal mine soil properties is vital to assess their suitability for the soil reclamation process.\nThe present study addresses this gap by comparing the soil properties under native and exotic woody species established on coal mine spoils after 5-years from the available data. Researchers did an intensive ecological study during 1993–1996 to investigate each planted species’ overall effect, either native or exotic or legume or non-legumes, on degraded soil of mine spoils (Dutta and Agrawal 2001, 2003; A. N. Singh, Raghubanshi, and Singh 2004b, 2004a; A. N. Singh and Singh 2006, 1999; A. Singh 2001; J. S. Singh, Singh, and Jha 1995). A comparable database between exotic and native species for vegetational and soil components was available only for 5-years-old plantation age. Therefore, in this paper, we compared the restoration efficiency of 5-year-old planted species in both variety (exotic and native) in terms of soil physical properties, total soil nutrients (SOC, TKN, and TP), available nutrients (Mineral N and P), N-mineralization, microbial biomass (MB-C, MB-N, and MB-P) and their nutrients from soil characters in redeveloping soil of mine spoil. We address the following questions from the comparison:\n\nWhich woody species are suitable for coal mine spoil restoration?\nAre exotic and native species differ in their soil restoration potentials?\nWhich soil parameters are more affected by origin of species?\nIs there any relationship between soil physicochemical properties under exotic and native plantations?"

P.) between latitudes 24°6′45″–24°11′15″ N and longitude 82°36′40″–82°41′15″ E. The study area is situated on a plateau above the plain on its southwest side. The average elevation at the foot of the plateau is around 300 m above mean sea level. The climate of the area is tropical monsoonal, and the year is divisible into a mild winter (November–February), a hot summer (April–June), and a warm rainy season (July–September). Data collected at a meteorological station present on the site showed that the mean monthly minimum temperature within the annual cycle ranges from 6–28°C and the mean monthly maximum from 20–40°C. The rainfall annually averages 1069 mm, of which about 90% occurs during late June to early September. The rainfall is characterized by a high degree of inter-annual variation; as during the study period 1980–1996, it ranges from 700 to 1450 mm/yr (A. N. Singh, Raghubanshi, and Singh 2004a).\n\n\nExperimental design\nAll the plantations (exotic and native) were raised in July–August by planting nursery-raised seedlings in previously dug pits of 40 × 40 × 40–cm size at a spacing of 2 × 2–m. Plantations of three native species: Albizia lebbeck (L.) Benth., Albizia procera (Roxb.) Benth. and Tectona grandis L.f. and three exotic species: Casuarina equisetifolia L., Cassia siamea Lam. and Grevillea pteridifolia Knight were raised in 1990 by planting seven to eight months old nursery raised seedlings. However, one native (Dendrocalamus strictus (Roxb.) Nees) and one exotic (Acacia auriculiformis A.Cunn. ex Benth.) were raised in 1991 by planting eight months of nursery-raised seedlings. The plantations have been raised for land rehabilitation as natural colonization is prolonged on the mine spoil. All the planted plots were seeded in 1994 at the rate of 6 kg/ha with Dinanath grass (Pennisetum pedicellatum Trin) to prevent soil erosion and loss of runoff nutrients. The total planted area for A. lebbeck, A. procera, C. equisetifolia, and G. pteridifolia was 1.5 ha, each, whereas the same for T. grandis, D. strictus, A. auriculiformis and C. siamea was about 0.5 ha, each. For sampling, three permanent plots were established for each species. The sample plots’ size was 25 × 25–m for A. lebbeck, A. procera, C. equisetifolia and G. pteridifolia, 15 × 15–m for T. grandis and D. strictus and 10 × 10–m for A. auriculiformis and C. siamea. Five individuals of average height and diameter (clumps in D. strictus) were marked in each replicate plot using waterproof paint for various measurements from 1993. The number of individuals (clumps in D. strictus) in each plot was inventoried in February 1993. Data collection was carried out annually in February–March.\n\n\nSample collection and analyses\nThree soil samples were collected at random from each of the three permanent plots using 15 × 15 × 10–cm monoliths during September 1995 and 1996. Each time, the samples from within a plot were thoroughly mixed to yield one composite sample per plot; this yielded three samples for each plantation on each sampling date. Large plant materials were removed, and the field-moist soil was sieved through a 2-mm mesh screen.\nEach soil sample was divided into two parts. One part in the field-moist condition was used to measure available nutrients (NH4-N, NO3-N, and PO4-P) and microbial C, N, and P. Organic C was determined by dichromate oxidation and titration with ferrous ammonium sulfate (Allen, Grimshaw, and Rowland 1986). Kjeldahl N was determined by the micro Kjeldahl method (Jackson 1958), and NH4-N was extracted by 2M KCl and analyzed by the phenate method (APHA 1985). NO3-N was measured by the phenol disulphonic acid method, using CaSO4 as the extractant (Jackson 1958). Bicarbonate extractable Pi was determined by the ammonium molybdate-stannous chloride method (Sparling, Whale, and Ramsay 1985). The soil was digested in a triple acid mixture of HClO4, HNO3, and H2SO4 (1:5:1), and the digest was analyzed for P by a phosphomolybdic acid blue color method (Jackson 1958). Microbial biomass C, N, and P were determined by chloroform fumigation and extraction methods described earlier (A. N. Singh, Raghubanshi, and Singh 2004b, 2004a; A. N. Singh and Singh 1999; Srivastava, Jha, and Singh 1989). Net nitrogen mineralization, nitrification, and ammonification were determined by in situ buried bag incubation method (Eno 1960). All results are expressed on an oven-dry soil (105°C, 24 hr) basis.\n\n\nStatistical analyses\nFirstly, the collected data was analysed to verify the assumptions of parametric tests. The normality of investigated parameters within groups (i.e., species and origin) was tested using the univariate Shapiro-Wilk test. It has better power than the other normality tests and therefore, it is widely recommended for testing normality. Next, we assessed the investigated parameters for homogeneity of variances across the groups. The Levene’s test, which is considered less sensitive to non-normal data, was used to assess the homogeneity of variances across the groups. Shapiro-Wilk test suggested that some variables were not normally distributed in our data. All variables were found to have homogeneous variance across the species, whereas some variables had unequal variances among the origin. The unequal variances among the origin can be compensated by moderate sample size (n = 12).\nSince some variables in data violated the assumptions of parametric tests, we chosen the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test to observe the effects of plantation species on spoil physicochemical parameters. The Kruskal-Wallis test is a rank-based test, which compares the mean ranks (medians) among the groups regardless of distribution of data. Next, we used the Dunn’s post-hoc test to discriminate the differences among the species for each investigated parameter. Dunn’s test has two advantages over pairwise Wilcoxon’s test: firstly, it retains the ranks produced Kruskal-Wallis test and, secondly, it also incorporates the pooled variance estimate implied by the null hypothesis of the Kruskal-Wallis test. The p-values computed by Dunn’s test were adjusted to control the family-wise error rate for multiple comparisons. These adjustments were made using the stepwise Holm method (also called Holm-Bonferroni adjustment), which is considered less conservative and more powerful than the Bonferroni method. We used the Wilcoxon’s rank sum test (also known as Mann-Whitney U test) to compare the variables between exotic and native species plantations. This test compares the difference in medians with relaxed assumption of normality of data. Across all the computed p-values, we considered p &lt; 0.05 as significant.\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) with scaling 2 was used to observe the correlations and patterns in the soil properties. Since the soil properties are expressed in different measurement units, we computed PCA from a correlation matrix as correlations are the covariances of standardized variables (Borcard, Gillet, and Legendre 2018). Pearson’s correlation coefficient was determined at 0.05 significance level to establish the relationships among soil properties.\nAll statistical analyses were performed in R language and statistical environment version 4.1.0 (R Core Team 2021). The rstatix (Kassambara 2021) and ggpubr (Kassambara 2020) packages were used for implementing all statistical tests and correlations. The R package tidyverse was used for data preparation and visualizations (Wickham et al. 2019) and package vegan was used for PCA (Oksanen et al. 2020)."

Similarly, the microbial biomass nitrogen (MB-N) was 4.76–10.84% under native plantations and 2.12–3.02% of total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) was in the exotic plantations (Table 6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: Microbial biomass nutrients relative to total nutrients in coal mine spoil under 5-year old plantations of native and exotic woody species\n\n\nSpecies\nRMBC (%)\nRMBN (%)\nRMBP (%)\nMBN: 2MBC\nMBP: 2MBC\n\n\n\n\nExotic\n\n\n\nAcacia auriculiformis\n\n\n2.46a\n\n\n2.14a\n\n\n2.2a\n\n\n4.91a\n\n\n1.47ab\n\n\n\n\nCassia siamea\n\n\n2.7a\n\n\n2a\n\n\n3a\n\n\n4.1a\n\n\n1.23b\n\n\n\n\nCasuarina equisetifolia\n\n\n2.62a\n\n\n3.4ab\n\n\n2.9a\n\n\n5.67a\n\n\n1.73ab\n\n\n\n\nGrevillea pteridifolia\n\n\n2.5a\n\n\n2.83ab\n\n\n6.5a\n\n\n6.07a\n\n\n2.32ab\n\n\n\nNative\n\n\n\nAlbizia lebbeck\n\n\n3.56a\n\n\n4.71ab\n\n\n8.25a\n\n\n6.34a\n\n\n3.17a\n\n\n\n\nAlbizia procera\n\n\n5.87a\n\n\n6ab\n\n\n6.4a\n\n\n6.73a\n\n\n2.67ab\n\n\n\n\nDendrocalamus strictus\n\n\n4.62a\n\n\n5.49ab\n\n\n8.25a\n\n\n5.93a\n\n\n2.5ab\n\n\n\n\nTectona grandis\n\n\n7.49a\n\n\n13.43b\n\n\n5.5a\n\n\n7.47a\n\n\n3.06a\n\n\n\n\nData for exotic species obtained from Dutta and Agrawal (2003) and Singh et al.

Thus, the PCA correlation biplot also supports the above derived relationships of soil texture with microbial biomass nutrients and nitrogen cycling, in addition to the relation of SOC and MBC.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Principal Component Analysis correlation biplot for the soil properties under the 5-year plantations of exotic and native species on coal mine spoil.

    "text": "Discussion\n\nSoil physico-chemical properties under exotic and native plantations\nFresh mine spoils are characterized by neutral pH, high bulk density, low water holding capacity (WHC), and deficiency of soil nutrients (A. N. Singh, Raghubanshi, and Singh 2004b). However, the older mine spoils have relatively better physical properties as compared to fresh spoils. Soil physical properties are distinctly better in the natural forests as compared to the mine spoil, suggesting that plantations improve soil physical properties (K. P. Singh and Mishra 1979). The present study found that the bulk density and pH were similar under both plantations indicating that both types of plantations have similar effects on bulk density and pH. Further, it might be possible a time frame of just five years might be insufficient to observe effects on bulk density and pH. The higher clay content under native species suggests that the roots of these species might have released some acidic substances, which caused chemical withering. Among native species, A. procera and A. lebbeck are most suitable for soil restoration (A. N. Singh, Raghubanshi, and Singh 2004a).\nSoil nutrients are usually associated with litterfall and litter decomposition rates, since litter is a major source of soil nutrients in terrestrial ecosystems. A recent comparison of 5-year-old exotic and native plantations on coal mine spoil suggested that native plantations have more litterfall and decomposition rates as compared to exotic plantations, though the differences were non-significant (A. N. Singh and Kumar 2022). Ammonification is the process of formation of organic nitrogen from the decomposition of organic matter including plant litter. The higher NH4-N under native plantations suggests a higher ammonification rate, which might be associated with relatively higher litterfall and faster decomposition rates under native plantations as compared to exotic plantations. Further, it also indicates that ammonifying bacteria might have developed and colonized faster under native plantations than the exotic plantations. On the other hand, the higher NH4-N and lower NO3-N under native species suggests a lower nitrification rate, which in turn indicate low abundance and activity of nitrifying bacteria (Isobe et al. 2020). Lower nitrification rates as compared to higher ammonification rates might be the consequence of underlying microbial diversity since the latter involves highly diverse microbes (Isobe et al. 2020). Further, the activity of nitrifiers is sensitive to water availability, drier conditions of the coal mine spoils might have restricted the nitrification rates (Isobe et al. 2020). Furthermore, it may also be possible that available NO3-N might be readily absorbed by the plants resulting in low net NO3-N under the native plantations. Similarly, inorganic phosphate under native plantations again suggests development of microbes including mycorrhizal fungi.\nAlthough the total soil organic carbon (SOC) and total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) were similar under both plantations, total phosphorus content was better under native plantations than the exotic plantations. Among native species, Albizia lebbeck and Dendrocalamus strictus seemed to be suitable to raise the C and N capital in the redevelopment soil of mine spoil (A. N. Singh, Zeng, and Chen 2006). However, these concentrations were considerably lower than those in natural deciduous forests (organic C = 0.47–2.1%, total N = 0.05–0.16%) (L. Singh and Singh 1993). The carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N ratio) determines the mineralization and immobilization of nutrients from the organic matter. A lower C:N ratio favors mineralization whereas a higher C:N ratio favors immobilization. The soil C:N ratio was close to 10:1 in the present study suggests faster mineralization to release nutrients. This ratio was slightly lower under native plantation (9.5:1) than the exotic plantation (9.8:1).\nThe nutrients in organic matter are first immobilized by the microbes in the form of microbial biomass. When these microbes die, the nutrients are released back to the soil through mineralization (J. S. Singh et al. 1989). Thus, higher microbial biomass nutrients are preferred for redevelopment and restoration of degraded soils because it aids in re-establishment of nutrient cycle (Srivastava, Jha, and Singh 1989). Therefore, the present study advocates the suitability of native species for recovery of nutrient cycling as the microbial biomass nutrients (C, N and P) were significantly higher native plantations as compared to exotic plantations. Further, the lower microbial biomass C:N ratio under native plantations suggests faster mineralization rates under these plantations as compared to exotic plantations. Moreover, microbes consumed a higher fraction of total soil nutrients under native plantations as indicated by higher values of microbial biomass nutrients to the total soil nutrients, which is considered as a measure of the success of reclamation efforts (Insam and Domsch 1988; Izquierdo et al. 2005). This higher nutrient immobilization rates under native plantations again favors native species plantations for re-establishment of nutrient cycling and rehabilitation of mine spoil.\n\n\nRelationships of soil physico-chemical properties\nThe relationships between soil organic matter, microbial biomass, and microbial activity have been proposed as soil maturity indicators (Insam and Domsch 1988). A positive linear relationship between soil organic carbon and microbial biomass carbon indicates that the two parameters mirror each other during the early soil redevelopment period. However, the relationship was stronger and more significant under native plantations as compared to the exotic plantations. This positive association suggests that increased input of organic carbon might reduce competition among heterotrophic microbes resulting in higher microbial biomass carbon. Thus, higher availability of energy substrate might have increased their assimilation and growth rates.\nSoil texture can influence the soil processes through effects on microbes, surface area, porosity and water availability. The amount and type of clay in a soil can affect mineralization rates as coarse-textured soils low in clay tend to increase the rate, and as the soil clay content increases, the rate decreases. A very strong positive correlation among the microbial biomass nutrients (C, N, P) suggests that these are associated with each other i.e., carbon acquisition is also accompanied by acquisition of nitrogen and phosphorus by the microbes.\nConsidering all together, all the species substantially differed in their soil restoration potential possibly due to individual species traits. All native species performed much better than the exotic species in improving soil physicochemical properties of coal mine spoil. Among native species, A. lebbeck can be considered as the most suitable species for degraded soil which is advocated by earlier studies (A. N. Singh, Raghubanshi, and Singh 2004b, 2004a). However, the soil restoration potential of T. grandis was relatively lower than other native species but still better than exotic species. This might be due to slow growth rates and low amount of litterfall under these plantations. However, T. grandis species cannot be ignored due to its high economic importance and higher rates of biodiversity development under plantations of this species as compared to other native species (Kumar et al. 2020). Thus, all the species can be broadly divided into three groups (i) all exotic species, (ii) T. grandis, and (iii) native species excluding T. grandis in order of better soil restoration potential in terms of soil physicochemical properties such as soil texture, soil nutrients and nutrient cycling."

    "text": "Conclusions\nThe present study suggested that exotic and native species differ in their soil restoration potential of coal mine spoil. Native species are clearly more effective for soil redevelopment and restoration than the exotic species irrespective of their leguminous or non-leguminous nature. Soil physicochemical properties such as clay content, available soil nutrients and fertility can be substantially improved by planting more native species than the exotic species. Thus, an optimal combination of plantation species with highest soil-building capacities should be planted on coal mine spoils.native species have satisfactory performance in the restoration of coal mine habitat rather than by exotic species. However, more comparative knowledge on the species-specific effects on ecosystem restoration is still required. The increased understanding about soil properties relationships will be beneficial to restoration practitioners for assessing the soil quality. Our study provided the evidence for positive relationship of microbial biomass carbon and soil organic carbon. Also, the positive association of microbial biomass nutrients with clay content and nitrogen mineralization rates were supported by our data. Thus, soil clay content can be used as an indicator for soil quality during ecological restoration."

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nGlobal environmental change is expected to substantially alter the biogeochemistry and nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems (Shu et al. 2019). Among terrestrial ecosystems, forest ecosystems acts as significant sink for soil organic matter and therefore, substantially influence the global nutrient cycling (Pan et al. 2011). The cycling of nutrients is primarily regulated by the process of litter decomposition, which releases nutrients from plant biomass to the soils (Shu et al. 2019; Patil, Kumar, Kumar, and Singh 2020). Much of the variations in the litter decomposition rates are explained by climate and litter quality (Zhang et al. 2008; Cornwell et al. 2008; Patil, Kumar, Kumar, Cheema, et al. 2020). However, the remaining proportion of variation is often attributed to the composition and activity of decomposer organisms (McGuire and Treseder 2010; Sulman et al. 2017). Among decomposer organisms, bacteria and fungi are two major group organisms involved in litter decomposition (Schneider et al. 2012; Heijden et al. 2015). Although the role of saprotrophic fungi is appreciated in litter decomposition, mycorrhizal fungi can also substantially influence litter decomposition because they often act as mediators of nutrients between plants and soil (Finlay 2005; Frey 2019; Kumar et al. 2021). Among the mycorrhizal associations, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) are commonly associated with vascular plants (Brundrett and Tedersoo 2018). While the AMF dominates the tropical forests, EMF associations are frequently observed in extra-tropical forests (Steidinger et al. 2019). Thus, the effects of mycorrhizal fungi are expected to vary not only among mycorrhizal groups, but also across the plant species, ecosystems and environmental conditions.\nMycorrhizal fungi have been observed to decrease the litter decomposition rates (Ruth L. Gadgil and Gadgil 1971; Ruth L. Gadgil and Gadgil 1975), which is frequently referred as ‘Gadgil effect’ in the literature (Ruth L. Gadgil and Gadgil 1971; Fernandez and Kennedy 2016). The ‘Gadgil effect’ has been observed for both ectomycorrhizal (Ruth L. Gadgil and Gadgil 1971) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Leifheit, Verbruggen, and Rillig 2015). The resource competition between saprotrophs (free living microbes) and symbionts (mycorrhizal fungi) have been suggested to retard the decomposition rates in presence of mycorrhizal fungi (Ruth L. Gadgil and Gadgil 1971; Brzostek et al. 2015). The specialized enzymatic suite and foraging behaviour of these mycorrhizal fungi have been attributed to their ability to outcompete the saprotrophic fungi or other detritivore community (Averill, Turner, and Finzi 2014; Talbot et al. 2015). Further, a literature review (Fernandez and Kennedy 2016) has also ascribed Gadgil effect to nitrogen competition (Orwin et al. 2011; Averill, Turner, and Finzi 2014), chemical inhibition or allelopathy (Krywolap, Grand, and Casida Jr. 1964; Rasanayagam and Jeffries 1992), myco-parasitism (Kubicek et al. 2011), and altered moisture-regimes (Koide and Wu 2003).\nIn contrast to Gadgil effect, mycorrhizal fungi also reported to enhance the litter decomposition rates (Frey 2019) through extracellular enzymatic degradation (Talbot et al. 2015), oxidation via Fenton chemistry (Beeck et al. 2018), and priming effects, i.e., stimulation of growth and activities of saprotrophic decomposers by providing plant-derived carbon sources (Herman et al. 2012; Gorka et al. 2019). The priming effects appear to be more widespread as mycorrhizal fungi have limited genetic capabilities to produce organic matter degrading enzymes (Frey 2019). The availability of labile exudates together with mycorrhizal necromass stimulates the activity of free-living bacteria and saprotrophic fungi, which leads to higher decomposition rates (Fernandez and Kennedy 2016). Further, the the differences in ecophysiology of mycorrhizal groups are expected to modulate their effects on litter decomposition rates (Tedersoo and Bahram 2019). For instance, the capacities for enzymatic degradation of organic matter widely vary among mycorrhizal taxa and it appears that EMF taxa have more degrading capacities than the AMF taxa (Frey 2019). Therefore, considering the type of mycorrhizal association can be important in understanding the role of mycorrhizal fungi in nutrient cycling.\nThus, available literature suggest that mycorrhizal fungi can either enhance the litter decomposition by providing plant-derived carbon-source (Zhu and Ehrenfeld 1996; Shah et al. 2016; Gui et al. 2017; Sterkenburg et al. 2018) or suppress it by competing for the same resources with saprotrophic fungi, also known as ‘Gadgil effect’ (Ruth L. Gadgil and Gadgil 1971; Ruth L. Gadgil and Gadgil 1975; Brzostek et al. 2015). Nevertheless, some studies found little or no effects of mycorrhizal association on litter decomposition (Staaf 1988). Therefore, the effects of mycorrhizal association on litter decomposition remained equivocal and highly variable in magnitude and direction, suggesting more complex mechanisms and contexts than previously thought (Fernandez and Kennedy 2016). Although few exemplary syntheses about the effects of mycorrhizal association on litter decomposition exist (Averill, Turner, and Finzi 2014; Fernandez and Kennedy 2016), quantitative estimates and direction of such effects remained ambiguous. Further, none of the earlier syntheses conducted a formal meta-analysis and their general conclusions might be confounded by sampling error or other sources of variations. Therefore, our primary objective is to quantitatively synthesise the magnitude and direction of mycorrhizal effects on litter decomposition rates in forest ecosystems. Further, we can expect substantial differences in effect due to species identity and phylogenetic relatedness among them because each species may have different quality of litter which can influence the decomposition rates. In addition to this, we aim to identify the knowledge gaps and suggestions for future investigations. Specifically, we aim to address the following questions:\n\nDo mycorrhizal presence affect rates of litter decomposition in forest ecosystems?\nWhat is the magnitude and direction of mycorrhizal effects on litter decomposition rates?\nAre these effects influenced by species or their phylogenetic relatedness?\nDo these effects differ between angiosperms and gymnosperms?\n\nTo accomplish this, we carried out a formal meta-analysis of available data from systematically identified comparable studies. In this meta-analysis, we included a forest plot showing the overall effect mycorrhizal fungi on litter decomposition, between-study heterogeneity, and a funnel plot for showing publication bias of studies. We explored different meta-analytic models and assessed the robustness of our estimates. Then, we discussed the results of all studies briefly. In the end, we draw conclusions of the mycorrhizal effect on litter decomposition based on the results of our meta-analysis."

Further, the quality and reproducibility of meta-analysis was ensured by adhering to previously recommended guidelines (Koricheva and Gurevitch 2014; Nakagawa et al. 2017).\n\nLiterature search\nWe systematically searched Scopus (https://scopus.com/) and Web of Science Core Collection (https://webofknowledge.com/) on 17-18 February 2021 with the following search string:\n\n(mycorrhiza* OR ectomycorrhiza* OR “saprotrophic fungi” OR plant-fung*) AND (litter OR “litter decay” OR (litter AND decompos*) OR decomposition OR “nutrient acquisition”) AND (forest).\n\nThis search string was developed by combining previously identified groups of keywords (see Supplementary Information). Additionally, Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/) was searched on 18-Feb-2021 using “Mycorrhiza decomposition” and “Mycorrhiza nutrient acquisition”. Thus, we obtained 789 records from Scopus, 1,293 records from Web of Science Core Collection, and 14 records from Google Scholar. All these 2,096 records were exported as BibTex files for further processing (see details in Supplementary Information).\n\n\nArticle screening\nOur article screening involved de-duplication, title and abstract screening, and full-text screening. We left 1,455 records after de-duplication, and 641 duplicates were removed (Figure 1). All these records were imported to freely available Mendeley reference management software for further screening. We manually screened titles and abstracts of each document following a pre-defined criterion (see Supplementary information). Based on the title and abstract screening, we excluded 1,265 articles and left with 190 articles (Figure 1). We could not retrieve the full-text of six articles (see Supplementary information Table S2) and, therefore, excluded these six articles. Next, the full text of each article was screened based on PICO inclusion and exclusion criteria (Supplementary information Table S3). Full-text screening resulted in the exclusion of 181 articles based on PICO criteria (Figure 1). Thus, we were finally left with only three eligible studies (Entry, Rose, and Cromack 1991; Zhu and Ehrenfeld 1996; Lang et al. 2021). We further employed snowballing method to identify related eligible studies. We could not identify any suitable related study based on references of selected studies (backward snowballing). However, two more eligible articles (Mayor and Henkel 2006; Fernandez, See, and Kennedy 2020) were identified through forward snowballing (citation tracking). Thus, five studies were included after article screening and snowballing.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Schematic flow diagram for literature search, screening and inclusion process (modified from Haddaway et al. 2018)\n\n\n\n\nData extraction\nWe needed data on litter decomposition rates in the presence and absence of mycorrhizal fungi to test our hypothesis. The litter decomposition rate is often expressed as annual decay constant usually estimated from Olson’s single exponential model (Olson 1963). Therefore, we aimed to extract the decay constant (\\(\\kappa\\)) and associated standard error (SE) or standard deviation (SD) for each study to establish consistency in our analysis. Unfortunately, only a single study (Entry, Rose, and Cromack 1991) reported the data in required form. All other studies have represented litter decomposition rates as mass remaining at different time intervals (Zhu and Ehrenfeld 1996; Mayor and Henkel 2006; Fernandez, See, and Kennedy 2020; Lang et al. 2021). In such cases, we extracted each remaining mass value in triplicate (one mean value and two standard error of mean values) at each given time interval using the WebPlotDigitizer (https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/). Thus, the actual number of replicates of litterbags at each sampling time was not taken into account; instead, we considered each data point as a sample to obtain a more uniform and comparable measure of litter mass remaining. In case of any ambiguity in timings, we considered the time stated in the methodology section of the published article (Lang et al. 2021).\nWhen the mass remaining data was available, the decay constant (\\(\\kappa\\)) and its associated standard error (SE) was estimated by fitting a linearised form of Olson’s single exponential decay model (Olson 1963) as represented in (Equation 1).\n\\[\n\\log(M_t) = -\\kappa~t + \\log(M_0)\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere \\(M_0\\) is the initial litter mass, \\(M_t\\) is the mass remaining at time \\(t\\), and \\(\\kappa\\) is the decay constant. When a study reported data for the same species at different sub-sites (Fernandez, See, and Kennedy 2020) or different seasons (Entry, Rose, and Cromack 1991), we estimated or recorded the decay constant (\\(\\kappa\\)) and its associated standard error (SE) or standard deviation (SD) separately. In addition to this, we recorded the plant species, mycorrhizal types, forest ecosystem types, litter types, and geographic coordinates of study sites. Further, we also noted technical information about methodologies, including the number of study experiments, duration of the investigation, exclusion method for mycorrhizal fungi, and the characteristics of litter and litter bags.\n\n\nPhylogenetic data\nTo test the influence of phylogenetic relatedness, we used the recently published GBOTB backbone of phylogeny for seed plants, which is based on data from GenBank and Open Tree of Life (Smith and Brown 2018). It is considered as the largest dated phylogeny for 79,881 taxa of seed plants resolved at species level. We used the package V.PhyloMaker2 (version 0.1.0) to prepare a phylogenetic tree for the selected plant species (Jin and Qian 2022). The phylogeny was generated from the GBOTB.extended.LCVP mega-tree, which is a combination of two published phylogenies for plants (Smith and Brown 2018; Zanne et al. 2014). Plant names in this phylogenetic tree are standardised according to the Leipzig Catalogue of Vascular Plants (LCVP) (Freiberg et al. 2020). The nodes were built using the build.nodes.1.LCVP function, which returns the most recent common ancestor of all the tips in the largest cluster of the genus, and define it as the basal node of the genus. Further, the phylogeny was generated under the Scenario 3 for binding of new genus tip to the family branch as defined in earlier study (Qian and Jin 2016).\n\n\nEffect size and variance\nVarious effect sizes are used to summarize the magnitude and direction of the relationship between two variables (Cooper, Hedges, and Valentine 2019; Harrer et al. 2021). Among available effect sizes, response ratios (also called as Ratio of Means) and standardised mean differences have been frequently used to compare the means between two groups (i.e., experimental and control) in ecology and evolution (Nakagawa and Santos 2012; Koricheva and Gurevitch 2014). The response ratio or ratio of means is recommended when the mean of control group is not very small as compared to experimental group and both groups have estimates of same sign either positive or negative (Hedges, Gurevitch, and Curtis 1999; Lajeunesse 2015). The log transformation of response ratio (\\(\\text{lnRR}\\)) makes the metric equally sensitive to changes in both numerator and denominator, apart from making the metric nearly normal. Thus, it measures the actual difference in responses scaled to mean in control groups. However, \\(\\text{lnRR}\\) is considered to be slightly biased towards null effects and usually estimate high heterogeneity than other effect size measures (Lajeunesse 2015).\nSince the rate of litter decomposition is influenced by time (i.e., greater weight loss during initial phase than the later phases), we decided to compare decay constant rather than the weight loss. The log transformed response ratio (\\(\\text{lnRR}\\)) and associated variance was calculated using the (Equation 2).\n\\[\n\\text{lnRR} = \\ln \\left( \\frac{\\bar X_E}{\\bar X_C} \\right); \\quad\n\\text{Var(lnRR)} = \\frac {SD_E^2}{n_E \\bar X_E^2} + \\frac {SD_C^2}{n_C \\bar X_C^2}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere, \\(\\bar X_E\\) and \\(\\bar X_C\\) represents the absolute litter decay constant (\\(\\kappa\\)) for experimental (presence of mycorrhizal fungi) and control (absence of mycorrhizal fungi) groups, respectively. The large-sample approximation was used to compute the sampling variances (Equation 2) associated with the effect size \\(\\text{lnRR}\\) (Hedges, Gurevitch, and Curtis 1999). The accuracy of \\(\\text{lnRR}\\) was ensured with with Geary’s test (Equation 3) for both control and experimental group (Lajeunesse 2015).\n\\[\n\\frac{\\bar X}{SD} \\sqrt{N} \\geq 3\n\\tag{3}\\]\nA positive value of response ratio (\\(\\text{lnRR} &gt; 0\\)) indicates faster whereas a negative value (\\(\\text{lnRR} &lt; 0\\)) means slower decomposition rates in presence of mycorrhizal fungi, and a value close to zero (\\(\\text{lnRR} \\approx 0\\)) indicates little or no effect. Both effect size and associated sampling variances were calculated using the function escalc() from the metafor package (Viechtbauer 2010).\n\n\nMeta-analytic model\nThe overall aim of meta-analyses is to combine the effects or observations from different studies. There are three main types of meta-analytic models i.e., fixed-effect model (FEM), random-effects model (REM), and multilevel model (MLM), which are commonly used to compute the overall effect estimate in meta-analysis. The most basic fixed-effect or common-effect model assumes a common overall mean for all studies. Since it assumes homogeneity between studies, it is far from the reality, at least for ecological studies. In contrary to the fixed effect model, the assumptions of random-effects model are more realistic as it considers between-study heterogeneity. This model assumes that there is not only one actual effect size but a distribution of true effect sizes (Borenstein et al. 2010; Harrer et al. 2021). According to this model, the observed effect size \\(y_i\\) with variance \\(v_i\\) deviates from the mean true effect size \\(\\mu\\) for a single study \\(i\\) (with \\(i = 1, \\ldots , N_{studies}\\)) by two error terms \\(u_i\\) (between-study heterogeneity) and \\(e_i\\) (sampling error). Thus, the random effects model can be expressed as (Equation 4)\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ny_i &= \\mu + u_i + e_i\\\\\n\\textbf{u} &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_u^2 \\textbf{I}_u) \\\\\n\\textbf{e} &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\textbf{V})\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{4}\\]\nwhere, \\(u_i\\) is the random effect corresponding to the \\(i^{th}\\) study, \\(\\textbf{u}\\) is a \\(1 \\times N_{studies}\\) column vector with the \\(u_i\\) values (which are assumed to be normally distributed with mean \\(0\\) and variance \\(\\sigma_u^2\\)) and \\(\\textbf{I}_u\\) is an \\(N_{studies} \\times N_{studies}\\) identity matrix, \\(\\textbf{e}\\) is a \\(1 \\times N_{studies}\\) column vector with the \\(e_{i}\\) values (which are assumed to be normally distributed with mean \\(0\\) and variance \\(v_i\\)), \\(0\\) is a column vector of zeros and \\(\\textbf{V}\\) is an \\(N_{studies} \\times N_{studies}\\) matrix with the \\(v_i\\) values along the diagonal.\nAlthough the random-effects model is commonly used in ecology, it did not take into consideration the non-independence among effect sizes (Nakagawa and Santos 2012). The non-independence can arise when the effect sizes are shared by studies (i.e., multiple effect sizes from the same study). Further, phylogenetic relatedness among species can also introduce non-independence among the effect size estimates (Cinar, Nakagawa, and Viechtbauer 2021). This issue of non-independence can be addressed by using a multilevel (hierarchical) meta-analytic model, which considers a random effect at each level of variability in effect sizes. Among the several factors for non-independence of effect sizes, we specifically assessed the dependence due to studies, species and phylogenetic relatedness among species as described recently (Cinar, Nakagawa, and Viechtbauer 2021). We used a complex multilevel meta-analytic model mathematically expressed in (Equation 5)\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ny_{ijk} &= \\mu + u_{ij} + s_i + n_k + p_k + e_{ij} \\\\\n\\textbf{u} &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_u^2 \\textbf{I}_u) \\\\\n\\textbf{s} &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_s^2 \\textbf{I}_s) \\\\\n\\textbf{n} &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_n^2 \\textbf{I}_n) \\\\\n\\textbf{p} &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_p^2 \\textbf{A}) \\\\\n\\textbf{e} &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\textbf{V})\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{5}\\]\nwhere\n\n\\(y_{ijk}\\) is the \\(j^{th}\\) effect (with \\(j = 1, \\ldots, N_i\\), where \\(N_i\\) is the number of effect sizes reported in the \\(i^{th}\\) study) in the \\(i^{th}\\) study (with \\(i = 1, \\ldots, N_{studies}\\)) for the \\(k^{th}\\) species (with \\(k = 1, \\ldots, N_{species}\\)), and \\(v_{ijk}\\) are corresponding sampling variances,\n\\(\\mu\\) is the overall meta-analytic mean,\n\\(u_{ij}\\) is a random effect corresponding to the \\(j^{th}\\) effect size in the \\(i^{th}\\) study,\n\\(s_i\\) is a study-specific random effect for \\(i^{th}\\) study,\n\\(n_k\\) is a species-specific random effect for \\(k^{th}\\) species,\n\\(p_k\\) denotes the phylogenetic random effect for the \\(k^{th}\\) species,\n\\(e_{ij}\\) is the sampling error or residual corresponding to the \\(j^{th}\\) effect size in the \\(i^{th}\\) study,\n\\(\\textbf{u}\\) is a \\(1 \\times N_{total}\\) column vector with the \\(u_{ij}\\) values (which are assumed to be normally distributed with mean \\(0\\) and within-study variance \\(\\sigma_u^2\\)), \\(N_{total} = \\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{studies}} N_i\\) represents the total number of the effect sizes, \\(\\textbf{I}_u\\) is an \\(N_{total} \\times N_{total}\\) identity matrix,\n\\(\\textbf{s}\\) is a \\(1 \\times N_{studies}\\) column vector with the \\(s_i\\) values (which are assumed to be normally distributed with mean \\(0\\) and between-study variance \\(\\sigma_s^2\\)), \\(\\textbf{I}_s\\) is an \\(N_{studies} \\times N_{studies}\\) identity matrix,\n\\(\\textbf{n}\\) is a \\(1 \\times N_{species}\\) column vector with the \\(n_k\\) values (which are assumed to be normally distributed with mean \\(0\\) and between-species variance \\(\\sigma_n^2\\)) and \\(\\textbf{I}_n\\) has dimensions \\(N_{species} × N_{species}\\),\n\\(\\textbf{p}\\) is a \\(1 \\times N_{species}\\) column vector with the \\(p_k\\) values (which are assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution with mean \\(0\\) and variance–covariance matrix \\(\\sigma_p^2 \\textbf{A}\\), where \\(\\sigma_p^2\\) denotes between-species variance due to the phylogeny, and \\(\\textbf{A}\\) is the \\(N_{species} \\times N_{species}\\) phylogenetic correlation matrix), and\n\\(\\textbf{e}\\) is a \\(1 \\times N_{total}\\) column vector with the \\(e_{ij}\\) values and \\(\\textbf{V}\\) is the corresponding (diagonal) variance–covariance matrix with dimensions \\(N_{total} \\times N_{total}\\).\n\nThe random-effects model was fitted using the rma() function whereas the complex multilevel meta-analytic model was fitted using the rma.mv() function from the metafor package (Viechtbauer 2010). The amount of heterogeneity under the both models were estimated using the less biased restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimator (Viechtbauer 2005). The phylogenetic correlation matrix, denoted as \\(\\textbf{A}\\) in (Equation 5), was computed under the Brownian model using the function vcv() from the ape package version 5.7.1 (Paradis and Schliep 2019). The branch lengths for each species was computed with the Grafen’s method (Grafen 1989) using the function compute.brlen() from the same package (Paradis and Schliep 2019).\n\n\nHeterogeneity\nThe heterogeneity reflects the variations in true effect sizes, which is not accounted by the sampling error variance within the meta-analysis. Cochran’s \\(Q\\) is traditionally used in meta-analysis to assess the heterogeneity in meta-analysis (Cochran 1954). It is the inverse variance weighted sum of squares, which can be mathematically represented by (Equation 6)\n\\[\nQ = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{studies}} w_i (y_i - \\mu)^2;\n\\quad w_i = \\frac{1}{v_i}\n\\tag{6}\\]\nwhere \\(y_i\\) is the observed effect for each study \\(i^{th}\\); \\(\\mu\\) is the overall summary effect, \\(w_i\\) is the weight defined as inverse of variance (\\(1/v_i\\)) for \\(i^{th}\\) study.\nAlthough Cochran’s \\(Q\\) has been widely used to test heterogeneity in meta-analyses (Nakagawa and Santos 2012; Koricheva and Gurevitch 2014), it is sensitive to size and precision of studies included meta-analysis (Borenstein et al. 2009; Harrer et al. 2021). Higgins and Thompson’s \\(I^2\\) statistic presents the more standardized form to estimate the between-study heterogeneity. It is defined as the percentage of variability in the effect size that is not caused by sampling error (Higgins and Thompson 2002). Similarly, the \\(H^2\\) statistic is used to describe the variance in observed effect sizes due to sampling error (Higgins and Thompson 2002). It is estimated as the ratio of observed variation to the expected variance due to sampling error. Although both \\(I^2\\) and \\(H^2\\) are measured based on the Cochran’s \\(Q\\), the Higgins and Thompson’s \\(I^2\\) and \\(H^2\\) were calculated based on more general definitions using the (Equation 7).\n\\[\nI^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_u^2}{\\sigma_u^2 + \\sigma_e^2} \\times 100; \\quad\nH^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_u^2 + \\sigma_e^2}{\\sigma_e^2}; \\quad\n\\sigma_e^2 =\\frac{(N_{studies}-1)\\sum w_i}{(\\sum w_i)^2 - \\sum w_i^2}\n\\tag{7}\\]\nwhere \\(\\sigma_u^2\\) is the between-study variance (also referred as \\(\\tau^2\\)), \\(\\sigma_e^2\\) is the typical within-study variance, \\(N_{studies}\\) is the total number of studies, \\(w_i\\) is the weight defined as inverse of variance (\\(1/v_i\\)) for \\(i^{th}\\) study. We also included a prediction interval for the true overall summary effect (\\(\\mu\\)) because high heterogeneity is expected for ecological studies (Senior et al. 2016).\nSince \\(Q\\) and \\(I^2\\) are not designed to assess between-study heterogeneity for multilevel models (Nakagawa and Santos 2012), we computed heterogeneity \\(I^2\\) for our multilevel model as suggested earlier (Nakagawa and Santos 2012). Following the previous mathematical notations, the within-study heterogeneity \\(I_u^2\\) can be represented as (Equation 8) whereas \\(H^2\\) or phylogenetic heritability can be represented by (Equation 9). The values of \\(H^2\\) can range from 0 to 1, which corresponds to no phylogenetic relatedness to exact proportional to phylogenetic relatedness among effect sizes.\n\\[\nI_u^2 = \\frac {\\sigma_u^2} {\\sigma_u^2 + \\sigma_s^2 + \\sigma_n^2 + \\sigma_p^2 + \\sigma_e^2}\n\\tag{8}\\]\n\\[\nH^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_p^2}{\\sigma_u^2 + \\sigma_s^2 + \\sigma_n^2 + \\sigma_p^2}\n\\tag{9}\\]\nMeta-regression: The heterogeneity in the observed outcomes can be explained using a set of predictors or moderators in meta-analysis. Such effect size partitioning among various variables is sometimes known as subgroup analysis. In absence of potentially better predictors, we explored species identity and clade (angiosperm or gymnosperm) as predictors since they can act as a surrogate for species level traits including the litter quality. We fitted mixed-effects models to assess the clade-specific or species-specific variations in the effects.\nOutlier and influential analysis: The overall pooled effect size can be heavily influenced by one or more outcomes (effect size), so that our estimated effect size is not robust. We assessed the outliers and influential cases using the studentised residuals and Cook’s distances for our random effects model (Viechtbauer and Cheung 2010). Outcomes with a studentised residual larger than the \\(100 \\times (1 − 0.05 / (2 \\times N_{total}))^{th}\\) percentile of a standard normal distribution are considered potential outliers (i.e., using a Bonferroni correction with two-sided \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) for \\(N_{total}\\) outcomes included in the meta-analysis). Similarly, outcomes with a Cook’s distance larger than the median plus six times the interquartile range of the Cook’s distances are considered to be influential.\n\n\nPublication bias\nThe publication bias in the average effect size was assessed using the classical funnel plot. It is a scatter plot of the observed effect size for each study on the x-axis against a measure of the standard error on the y-axis of each study. In the absence of any publication bias, effect size distribution should roughly follow the funnel shape in the plot. We conducted the rank correlation test (Begg and Mazumdar 1994) and the regression test (Sterne and Egger 2006) to assess the asymmetry in the funnel plot. The regression was carried using the standard error of the observed outcomes as predictor.\nFurther, we computed the fail-safe numbers to assess the robustness of estimated average effect. Fail-safe numbers estimate the number of non-significant and or unpublished studies which would reduce the significance of overall average estimate if included in the meta-analysis. We used the unweighted Rosenthal’s (Rosenthal 1979) and weighted Rosenberg’s (Rosenberg 2005) approaches to estimate the fail-safe numbers.\nAll analyses were performed in R programming language and statistical environment version 4.3.0 (R Core Team 2023). The R package metafor version 4.2.0 (Viechtbauer 2010) for statistical meta-analysis, package ggtree version 3.7.2 used for visualisation of phylogenetic tree (Yu et al. 2016) and package tidyverse version 2.0.0 (Wickham et al. 2019) for general data manipulation and visualization."

The leaf litter of nine plant species (Acer saccharum Marshall, Betula alleghaniensis Britton, Dicymbe corymbosa Benth., Fagus grandifolia Ehrh., Fraxinus americana L., Pinus rigida Mill., Pinus strobus L., Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco Quercus ellipsoidalis E. J. Hill) was used during the experiments (Figure 2 a). The duration of experiments is also differed among studies and ranged from one year to 2.4 years. The initial leaf litter mass varied from 1.0 g to 17.0 g, and three studies used up to 2.0 g of leaf litter, whereas two studies used more than 2.0 g of leaf litter (Entry, Rose, and Cromack 1991; Mayor and Henkel 2006). Further, most of the studies involved ectomycorrhizal fungi (Entry, Rose, and Cromack 1991; Zhu and Ehrenfeld 1996; Mayor and Henkel 2006; Fernandez, See, and Kennedy 2020), while one study showed the involvement of both ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Lang et al. 2021). All the studies assured mycorrhizal exclusion by trenching to 30 cm soil depth.\nFurther, our dataset revealed that most studies were conducted in the temperate deciduous forest of North America (n = 4), and only one study was conducted in the tropical forest of Guyana of South America’s North Atlantic Coast (Figure 2 b). The earliest study included was from 1991 (Entry, Rose, and Cromack 1991), whereas the latest study was published in 2021 (Lang et al. 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: (a) Phylogenetic relationship among the species used for litter decomposition. The symbols represents the studies to which a species belong. (b) Geographical distribution of studies included in our dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall effect estimate\nA total of 14 estimates of litter decomposition (\\(\\kappa\\)) were included in the meta-analysis (Figure 3). The observed response ratios (\\(\\text{RR}\\)) ranged from 0.74 to 1.58, with the majority of estimates being positive (71%). Thus, the decomposition rate is also expected to be higher in the presence of mycorrhizal fungi on average (Figure 3). Further, a strong positive relationship was observed between annual decay constants for the presence and absence of mycorrhizal fungi (R2 = 0.94, p &lt; 0.001), indicating that our dataset does not include extreme effect estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Effects of mycorrhizal fungi on annual litter decay constant (\\(\\kappa\\)). Each point represents a single comparison of \\(\\kappa\\). The color of each point denotes the change in \\(\\kappa\\) due to the presence of mycorrhizal fungi. Values above and below the 1:1 line represents the stimulation and inhibition of litter decomposition rate in presence of mycorrhizal fungi, respectively. The values falling on the 1:1 line represent the neutral or no effect\n\n\n\n\nConsistent with our expectations, both meta-analytic models also suggested an overall positive effect of mycorrhizal fungi on litter decomposition rates. The overall average effect estimate (\\(\\hat \\mu\\)) was 1.07 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.11) for the random effects model whereas the same was 1.08 (95% CI: 1, 1.18) for the multilevel model. The wider confidence intervals are expected in the latter model as it included additional sources of variations (number of levels, i.e., id, study, species). In ecological sense, these models indicated that on average the annual decay constant for leaf litter was 7-8% higher in presence of mycorrhizal fungi (Figure 4). The random-effects model found strong statistical evidence (Z = 3.58, p &lt; 0.001) whereas the multilevel model showed moderate statistical evidence (Z = 1.96, p = 0.05) for the accelerated decomposition rates. This positive effect is also evident in the forest plot, where the right-side position of the diamond demonstrates that litter decomposition rate increased in the presence of mycorrhizal fungi (Figure 4).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Forest plot showing the observed effects of mycorrhizal fungi on litter decomposition rates for each experiment (n = 14). The size of each square is proportional to the weight of each study, and the associated bars represent the 95% confidence interval associated with individual effect size. The diamonds at the bottom represent the overall average effect estimated from meta-analytic models. The length of diamond denotes the 95% confidence intervals whereas associated dotted lines indicate the 95% prediction intervals\n\n\n\n\nThe Cochran’s \\(Q\\) test for heterogeneity revealed significant variations (\\(Q\\) = 259.45, df = 13, p &lt; 0.001) in true outcomes. Further, very high value of Higgins & Thompson’s statistic (\\(I^2\\) = 97.85%; 95% CI: 97.77, 99.94) suggest that most of the observed variations captured the real differences in true effects (\\(\\tau^2\\) = 0.002). Similarly, the within-study variations in observed estimates were larger than the sampling error as indicated by \\(H^2\\) statistic (\\(H^2\\) = 46.43).\nConsistent with random-effects model, the multilevel model also indicated very high heterogeneity (\\(I_t^2\\) = 99.5%) in true outcomes. The main advantage of multilevel model is that it allows us to estimate the heterogeneity in true outcomes at different levels of meta-analytic model. This model suggested that the heterogeneity due to species-specific effects was very large (\\(\\sigma_n^2\\) = 0.007; \\(I_n^2\\) = 84.32%) followed by the within-study heterogeneity (\\(\\sigma_u^2\\) = 0.001; \\(I_u^2\\) = 15.22%). Interestingly, neither between-study heterogeneity (\\(\\sigma_s^2\\) = 0; \\(I_s^2\\) = 0) nor phylogeny-specific heterogeneity (\\(\\sigma_p^2\\) = 0; \\(I_p^2\\) = 0) was detected by our multilevel model. Since no phylogenetic effects were observed, the phylogenetic heritability (\\(H^2\\) = 0) was also absent.\nGiven the high heterogeneity in true outcomes, the 95% prediction interval ranged from 0.97 to 1.17 as computed by the random effects model. However, the multilevel model suggested a much wider 95% prediction interval ranging from as low as 0.89 to as high as 1.33. Since the predicted values of average estimate included values both lesser and greater than one, we can expect slower decomposition rates in some experiments, though the presence of mycorrhizal fungi enhanced the litter decomposition on average (Figure 4).\nThe meta-regression model with clade (Angiosperm vs Gymnosperm) as categorical moderator suggested that experiments using litter of gymnosperm species obtained on average smaller effect (\\(\\beta_1\\) = -0.03, SE = 0.05) as compared to angiosperms, though this difference was not statistically significant (\\(Q_M\\) = 0.31, df = 1, p = 0.578). Thus, inclusion of clade as moderator variable did not explained any variation in true effects. While the mixed-effects model with species as moderator reflected the variations of effect estimates among species (Figure 5). This meta-regression model indicated that at least one species had significantly different (higher or lower) response ratio than the response ratio for the reference level (Acer saccharum in our case). Thus, this model provided moderate statistical evidence that some amount of variations in true effects are indeed due to species (\\(Q_M\\) = 16.96, df = 8, p = 0.031). It appeared that about 29% of the total variations in the true outcomes were due to species. Although species explained some proportion of the total variations, there still exist variations in true effects that are not attributable to species. These unexplained variations are evident from the test for residual heterogeneity (\\(Q\\) = 239.52, df = 5, p &lt; 0.001), which suggested large amount of unexplained variations in true effects. Further, this unexplained heterogeneity has large variance (\\(\\tau^2\\) = 0.001) and it reflects the real variations that are not explained by species as suggested by high value of \\(I^2\\) = 98.8%.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The average effect of mycorrhizal association on litter decomposition rate for each species included in the meta-analysis. The values represent the average difference in response ratios compared to the reference species (Acer saccharum) and the associated bars denote the 95% confidence intervals\n\n\n\n\nFurther, the examination of the studentised residuals revealed that none of the studies had a value larger than ± 2.91 and hence there was no indication of outliers in the context of this model. Similarly, the inspection of Cook’s distances indicated that none of the studies could be considered overly influential.\n\n\nPublication bias\nThe visual inspection of the funnel plot did not indicate the publication bias as the outcomes appeared to be symmetrically distributed around the average effect estimate (Figure 6). The outcomes were well-fitted within the funnel as larger outcomes (with higher precision) were closely clustered at top whereas smaller outcomes (with lower precision) were dispersed around the average effect at bottom. Further, the funnel plot included nearly half outcomes in the non-significant region again suggesting absence of publication bias due to null findings of studies.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: The contour-enhanced funnel plot shows the effect size of each study (expressed as the response ratio) on the x-axis against a measure of their standard error (from large to small) on the y-axis. The vertical lines in the middle of the funnel show the average effect estimate and associated 95% confidence interval. The shaded region indicates the different significance levels for the estimated effect size for each outcome\n\n\n\n\nThe intercept estimated from the regression test (\\(\\beta_0\\) = 0.06; 95% CI: 0.016, 0.104) was not significantly higher than zero (Z = 0.51, p = 0.609). Also, there was non-significant low rank correlation (Kendall’s \\(\\tau\\) = -0.27, p = 0.193) between standard error and response ratio of outcomes. Thus, both the statistical tests for funnel asymmetry also corroborated our initial visual observations of funnel plot symmetry, which can be considered as indication of negligible or no evidence of publication bias for the present meta-analysis. (Figure 6).\nThe Rosenthal’s fail-safe N of 2107 suggested that over 2,000 outcomes with average response ratio of 1.0 need to be added to make the average effect non-significant (p = 0.05). Similarly, the Rosenberg’s fail-safe N was 4019, indicating that there would need to be over 4,000 outcomes with a mean response ratio of 1.0 added to the analysis, before the cumulative effect would become statistically non-significant (p = 0.05). Considering that we were able to identify only 14 relevant outcomes, it is unlikely that we missed over 4,000 or over 2,000 outcomes. Thus, although it may be possible that we might have estimated biased effect, it is unlikely that the actual overall effect is zero. However, we acknowledge that it is just one form of publication bias among the several other sources of bias in the estimate."

    "section": "Discussion",
    "text": "Discussion\nConsidering the initially posed questions, our analysis found moderate to strong evidence that mycorrhizal presence indeed affects the rate of litter decomposition in forest ecosystems (Question 1). The overall average estimate suggested that mycorrhizal fungi tends to enhance the litter decomposition rate by 7-8% on average (Question 2), though it can vary from a decrease of about 10% to an increase of over 30% in presence of mycorrhizal fungi. As with other ecological meta-analyses, large variations in effects were observed as indicated by potentially large heterogeneity. A small proportion (~30%) of these variations can be attributed to differences in species specific traits, possibly through litter quality (Question 3). However, no statistical evidence was found for the differences between angiosperm and gymnosperm species, though slightly higher enhancement was observed for angiosperms than the gymnosperms (Question 4). Further, these effects did not vary due to phylogenetic relationship among the included species (Question 3).\nIn contrast to expectations of Gadgil effect, our findings suggested an overall increase in the litter decomposition rates in presence of mycorrhizal fungi, which is consistent with previous findings (Shah et al. 2016; Gui et al. 2017; Frey 2019; Lang et al. 2021). The enhanced litter decomposition rates have been observed in the presence of both ectomycorrhizal (Shah et al. 2016) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Gui et al. 2017). The ectomycorrhizal-mediated enhancement was suggested to be associated with the secretion of enzymes to acquire nutrients from organic matter (Jackson et al. 2019). These enzymes degrade the complex compounds and make them available to other decomposer organisms. However, the increased litter decomposition in the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi was attributed to their saprotrophic capabilities, which tend to acquire nutrients directly from organic matter (Hodge, Campbell, and Fitter 2001; Herman et al. 2012). Further, both ectomycorrhizal (Brzostek et al. 2015) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Herman et al. 2012) are observed to increase the activity of microbial communities by providing plant-based carbon sources, i.e., priming effects. Since microbial communities are associated with the breakdown of complex compounds and the release of nutrients, their increased activity enhances the litter decomposition rate (Schneider et al. 2012). Thus, our findings question the generality of ‘Gadgil effect’ and suggest that the magnitude and direction of ‘Gadgil effect’ can be highly inconsistent and variable (Fernandez and Kennedy 2016).\nThe much wider range of average effect (-10% to 30%) in our analysis suggest that multiple variables are involved in deriving the mycorrhizal effects on litter decomposition. Such a wider range is expected because the rate of litter decomposition is not controlled by mycorrhizal effects alone and several factors including climate, litter quality and soil decomposer organisms are involved in determining the decomposition rates (Zhang et al. 2008; Cornwell et al. 2008; Kumar et al. 2021). Thus, the mycorrhizal-mediated litter decomposition rates may either hamper or stimulate depending upon the stage of decomposition, soil profile, climatic condition, plant species, and fungal species (Fernandez and Kennedy 2016; Sterkenburg et al. 2018). The species-specific effects are observed in our analysis, as species identity appeared to explain a small part of total variations in the mycorrhizal effects. This species-specific variation in mycorrhizal effects can be attributed to the resource allocation strategy of plant species. When mycorrhizal fungi receive more carbon from the host plant, they can invest more in enzymes and secondary metabolites (Rineau et al. 2013). This higher investment can directly increase the enzymatic degradation capacity of mycorrhizal fungi leading to faster decomposition rates. Further, high resource allocation can result in higher production of labile exudates leading to stimulation of growth and activity of saprotrophic microbes (priming effects).\nFurther, the species identity can indirectly affect mycorrhizal effects through the quality of litter produced by a species (Cornwell et al. 2008; Patil, Kumar, Kumar, Cheema, et al. 2020). It is observed that ‘high quality’ litter (low lignin and high nitrogen) decomposes more rapidly than the ‘low quality’ litter (high lignin, low nitrogen) (Patil, Kumar, Kumar, Cheema, et al. 2020). Suppose a species will produce ‘high quality’ litter (low lignin and high nitrogen). In that case, mycorrhizal effects will be weaker due to more activities of saprotrophic fungi and decomposer micro-organisms whereas ‘low quality’ litter (high lignin, low nitrogen and high carbon content) will favour strong mycorrhizal effects as it will become accessible to the mycorrhizal fungi. Thus, it seems that various factors modulate the effects of mycorrhizal fungi on litter decomposition rate; therefore, these effects can be highly context-dependent (Fernandez and Kennedy 2016).\nAlthough our meta-analysis supports the mycorrhizal-mediated faster decomposition rates, it suffers from some limitations and caveats. We expect that these limitations and caveats will inspire future investigations to advance our understanding about the role of mycorrhizal fungi in nutrient cycling. One of the major limitation of the present analysis is that the systematic literature search and screening resulted in a small number of comparable studies. Although the practice of systematic literature search and screening substantially improve the reproducibility of overall analysis, it may hamper us to identify all the evidence from the literature. Further, our strict eligibility criteria to identify comparable studies appeared to be overly narrower. Therefore, we suggest future research synthesis to include all possible studies across wider range of plant species and ecosystem types. Further, litter decomposition in natural ecosystems is regulated by a complex interaction of several factors (e.g., climate, soil, plant, and mycorrhizal fungi). However, our limited database did not allowed us to test the effects of these variables due to insufficient sample size. Furthermore, tropical forests are under-represented in our analysis, it may be possible that observed positive effects of mycorrhizal fungi are localised to temperate forests (Keller and Phillips 2019). Similarly, all the eligible studies considered only leaf litter for decomposition, the inclusion of litter from other sources might lead to variation in the results. Moreover, we have not considered the actual sample size, mean, and variation of measurements; instead, we considered the number of data points as the sample size to ensure the consistency among the studies. Finally, as with any systematic exercise, deviation from the systematic protocol (searching keywords, eligibility criteria) may lead to different results.\nWe encourage researchers to consider the known limitations of the present study. We observed that most studies considered leaf litter and litter from other sources (root, shoot, and wood) is lacking. Thus, there is a need to experiment with other litter along with leaf litter. Further, we suggest the future investigations to study the mycorrhizal effects on litter decomposition rates across biomes (grassland, heathland, temperate forest and tropical forest), plant species (angiosperm vs gymnosperm, exotic vs native species, leguminous vs non leguminous species, evergreen vs deciduous), litter type (fine roots vs leaf litter, high quality litter vs low quality litter), and mycorrhizal groups (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, ectomycorrhizal fungi, ericoid mycorrhizal fungi, orchid mycorrhizal fungi). Moreover, we need to investigate these effects along the gradients of climate, elevation and abundance of mycorrhizal fungi (i.e., trenching depth)."

    "text": "Conclusion\nOur analysis provides valuable insights into the influence of mycorrhizal fungi on litter decomposition rates in forest ecosystems, challenging the generality of the widely recognised ‘Gadgil effect.’ The overall findings suggest a tendency for increased litter decomposition rates in the presence of mycorrhizal fungi. However, the considerable variability observed across species highlights the involvement of multiple underlying mechanisms. While our results shed light on the potential importance of mycorrhizal fungi in regulating litter decomposition, caution must be exercised regarding the generalisability and interpretability of these effects and processes. The complex nature of mycorrhizal associations and their interactions with other factors in ecosystems necessitates a deeper understanding of the specific contexts in which mycorrhizal fungi regulate litter decomposition and the mechanisms involved. To advance our knowledge and modelling capabilities regarding nutrient cycling responses to changing environments, improving our understanding of the mechanisms by which mycorrhizal fungi exert their influence on litter decomposition is crucial. However, the limited availability of evidence on this topic underscores the need for additional data and further research to comprehensively elucidate the role of mycorrhizal fungi in the mechanisms driving litter decomposition. In conclusion, our meta-analysis serves as a catalyst for future research endeavours, stimulating further investigations that will enhance our understanding of the roles of mycorrhizal fungi in nutrient cycling regulation across various scales. By expanding our knowledge in this area, we can ultimately improve the accuracy and effectiveness of ecosystem models and management strategies."
